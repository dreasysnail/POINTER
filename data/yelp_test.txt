sparklings features: tasty intriguing meals , a traditional yet fun atmosphere , and surprisingly reasonable prices !
this place is good for a sushi fix . came here for dinner with my boyfriend and did the a you can eat . the sushi tastes good and sea food inside taste fresh . there s nothing that sets it apart fro the other sushi places , but if you don t wanna go all the way downtown this is a good spot . my only advice is , watch out for the appetizers the fried rice , miso soup , and edamame were pretty heavily salted . will most likely come back !
the food seems to have improved to me lately . had the japanese teriyaki noodles with veggies and tofu . couldn t finish it all and it was yummy . thrilled that they have a gluten free menu . the kids menu is inexpensive and good portions . next time my two youngest will share . my kids were in love with the soda dispenser . top all that off with free wi fi from paradise bakery next door and we ll be back !
this had long been a favorite of ours . the service is spot on and the food is fantastic . never had a meal that i didn t like at the deli den . the ruben and the rachel are my favorites and if you like delis style sandwiches , this will be your new favorite too .
i can t get tired of their delicious food and great customer service , i usually go for breakfast , they have fresh bagels and pastries everyday .
nice food , worst service i ve ever experience for same level restaurant . everything was great , until our server decided to watch me to make sure i leave a nice tips while i was paying by credit card . just because i am chinese , doesn t mean we don t tip . it is a very serious case of discrimination .
the team at the independence branch is fantastic . they truly care about you and your needs . they know your name and remember specifics about you . the cafe is outstanding and there is no pressure put upon you to busy certain services or products .
i ve eaten here a few times was never disappointed . great atmosphere , service food . i will definitely go back recommend to others . i love how they give you the choice of the way they grill your food love the added touch of them searching and lightly smoking my salad . many good selections on the menu that sometimes i just can t make up my mind there . great place that all should try out !
unique burger place located in chinatown . has a cool atmosphere inside and very tasty burgers as well . i definitely recommend checking it out if you re in vegas !
yummy excellent service . ordered the carne asada medium rare . it was perfect . and delicious . their customer service was awesome . they were so friendly and made sure all was good . i definitely recommend this place .
the best pho in my area , i ve tried others and this place has broth that isn t bland and has a good amount of meat included . i go there by myself and eat just because it s my favorite pho place . pricing is decent too !
i always go to tyler at bmw on sahara when i have vehicle problems . service is really friendly and all my questions and needs are answered efficiently . bmw service is expensive but it s top notch quality and worth every penny knowing it got done right .
great atmosphere , good food and drinks . i love coming here in the fall to spring to meet with clients . their inside is a little small and makes summer a bit tighter , but still a great staff with excellent service .
if you have time to get to a taste of caroline or fly out of this terminal , they have one of the better beer selections in the charlotte airport . their selection is solid and they carry better brews then carolina beer company . noda s hop , drop n roll and coco loco . yes , please . it s still airport pricing but worth it for a better beer .
great food and i especially like this location as the staff are really friendly and the girl at the cashier is super cute : ) .
great find . we came because of yelp and the food was terrific . friendly , wonderful service.
i like this place . i think it was buy one get one free burgers when we came in . our server was very good , constatnly checking back on us and refilling our sodas and waters . the place has a nice layout , tons of large tvs all around and cozy high top tables . food was tasty as well . i can t figure out what events they have here ( if any )  such as live music , karaoke , etc .
had a wonderful snoh boba milk tea at the phoenix night market . can t wait to visit the downtown location . cheers to drinks that are also a snack . 
fun atmosphere . the food isn t the best . lots of games to choose from . wouldn t suggest going on a date there . more of a group thing to have fun .
i am giving this five stars on behalf of my spouse . let me start out by saying , she doesn t even like massages but somehow this place drew her in . and she loved it . john is super strong and was able to apply the right amount of pressure . she deemed this a very relaxing , rejuvenating experience and will be a repeat customer . place is very clean and modern . receptionist is friendly and very thorough in her explanations .
variety of different seasonings is a plus , tried the bbq curly fries , really good . my service was friendly and made to order .
this place has nice tonkotsu ramen . the broth is creamy , rich , and it looks like they invest a lot of time producing the broth . if you re around the area and can t find a nice ramen ya san to go to , come here and enjoy a warm bowl of ramen !
first time trying filipino , and it was amazing . the beef cheek was to die for .
customer service mediocredrive thru is the worst . walked in got my drink before the drive thru vehicles.
first off , the service was absolutely fantastic and genuine , which creates a great environment from the start . the roasted garlic chicken pizza tasted great , but the butter cake stole the show .
affordable , efficient and always do a great job . even my boyfriend got his brows done here once . highly recommended !
good veggie tacos , great happy hour . staff is friendly .
this is my favourite fast food place , food it always soo good and fresh and it s ready pretty quick . you have to try it out !
just had the best couple massage . my therapist was tessa , who did an amazing job at hitting the stressed spots i pointed out . having some water and a hot tea after made it all the better . i ve gone to many spas all over montreal and the world . i will be back for sure . a very beautiful , zen , professional place to go .
service was okay . took forever just to even get water . food was alright . prices were good though . nice patio as well.
this is truly a gem in the scottsdale area fresh made pasta excellent food and service and very well priced would highly recommend pasta is made fresh daily some of the best italian food i ve ever had well worth the visit.
pretty good pizza although there is a small selection . small selection is the key description for this restaurant . it s got a neat look to it but it isn t much if anything special . i will stick with humble pie and grimaldi s .
best jukebox box on this side of town . i used to just come for breakfast but turns out its a great late night too .
i ordered a bouquet for my girlfriend s birthday . becky helped me with the order and put together a beautiful arrangement . delivery was right on time to her office . she was thrilled . will definitely recommend and use cutting garden again .
this place is amazing . everything i ve eaten here has been absolutely delicious , i m mean everything is fantastic not joking the host angel is as awesome as they come . great lounge area also.
service was terrible . it took forever to get our drink order taken . i will say it improved as time went on . food was ok . my tuna tartare was pretty good , salad was ok . chocolate coconut souffle was delicious .
i had a haircut with nicole today and it went perfect . i have had long hair for some time now and was a little nervous but she listened to what i wanted and did a wonderful job . price is fair for the type of service and expertise that you get . thanks flict and especially nicole .
my girlfriend dragged me into this joint because she always wants to keep up with the old town restaurant scene , however i m glad she did . i recommend the brussel sprout nachos , poke bowls are refreshing and delightful , and margarita s are superb . add the pink beet sauce to any food you order because it is hella fire . will definitely be making many trips back .
i have had in n out burger in los angeles . this is a poor representation of the restaurant . buns were dry french fries way salty and i was soooo upset . all we talked about before our trip was that we were going to eat at in n out burger .
roadrunner is a great company that provides a wonderful service . they are very professional and will work with you to help your animal out . i like how they send everything in the cool cartoon ups boxes too . i will continue to use roadrunner due to their great service and reliability . thanks !
walked in this afternoon with some pants that needed the hem repaired . the lady working took the pants repaired them on the spot . and the price beyond reasonable . i was literally in out of there , job done , in less than five minutes . so glad i finally found my go to tailor !
one of the best fish tacos i ve had in a long time every thing was nice and hot the fish tacos were so tasty and crunchy till the very last bite . jesse jaime gave outstanding customer service from when i walked thru that door till i left . had an amazing experience here at wahoo tacos diffently going to spread the word to family and friends about this location and i m coming back for more food . 
no good burnt tacos and burnt nachos old the oil is old as hell no meat in the tacos no flavor and just unfriendy people wont ever go back.
heard about yogurtland from fellow yelper niki , thanks my dear . the place was very clean . it had a great variety of flavors to choose from and plenty of great topings . if you want to go good and simple the yogurt tart is very good , i added pineapple , strawberry to mine . 
dont ask for butter here . they dont know the difference with natural healthy butter over chemical laden margerine nature over factory crap people.
good homemade food . if you are leaving vegas and need to get your life together , this is where it starts . you won t regret it . 
the location and restaurant setup is good . food quantity was very little the chilli chicken was very oily . price was good service was good.
i forgot to mention the dan dan is spicy apparently too much heat for a friend of mine , lol . tried the pad thai this time , it neither looked nor tasted like the traditional version , this one was a bit sweet and tangy , tasty . i definitely prefer the ramen shrimp soup to their house special which to me was a bit bland . wish they d delivered.
such a gem of a restaurant . i always get the baked seafood dish with rice and a cold hk milk tea . everything is affordable . i can t believe i didn t know of this place sooner .
the foot spa was nice but it s like getting a massage in a hospital next to a strip club loud music next door and the rooms aren t even separated . they have curtains to separate each person . it was not relaxing loud music next door and the lady doing my massage was giggling .
meredith was amazing . i was so impressed with how smoothly she ran her business and efficiently handled all her clients in a timely manner . we chose the extra strength formula and were warned that some clients experience teeth sensitivity , and while we both did have sensitive teeth that day , most of the pain dissipated by the next day .
i had been to this theatre when it was the colony , long before it was subdivided into multiple screens . good theatre for the area . parking can be challenging . nice to have multiple restaurants around it to stop for a bite before or after the show .
the arrogant butcher is located at city scape in downtown phoenix . they have a large selection of wines , beer , cocktails and daily specials . my favorite plate so far is the sweet potato tortelli with mushrooms , spinach and hazelnuts . i enjoy from the raw bar the oysters king crab legs . also you should try there baby back ribs and zucchini fritters . mi vida mi vida cocktail yay . i m a fan .
the food is fantastic , albeit on the pricier side . i ve liked almost everything i ve tried here: pythosalad: i think this one must be my favorite . all star: delicious corn chowder soup: it was more of a veggie soup ( not creamy , but more like minestrone )  but i actually loved it . this has been my favorite soup so far leak sweet potato: i wasn t a fan , sadly carrot soup: delicious the cons are: they re very strict with substitutions ( almost nothing can be substituted )  they re very slow ( although the servers are all super friendly , it gets quite busy and there aren t that many servers )  it s quite pricey.
the customer service was superb . my car was estimated to be ready in a week and they finished it in two days . lawrence and chris were wonderful . i will happily bring my car back there anytime:  ) .
quick and tasty . i ordered the vegetable thai basil fried rice and it tasted exactly how i wanted it . the service was good and the staff were very friendly .
great food , pretty meh name . very hard to find that style of dim sum in toronto with carts , freshly made food constantly coming from the kitchen and even waitresses are dressed in traditional attire . if you don t speak cantonese however make sure you know what you want to get , not a place to really ask for recommendations from the waitresses . things to order if you re not sure: hargow sumai jian dui trust me soup dumplings spare ribs.
excellent menu choices . happy hour had large variety . kids loved it . philly roll was delish , popcorn chicken salad was yummy . highly recommend paradise roll . i will be back .
came here for a school physical for my son . came in and was out the door within an hour . great staff and doctor , super friendly and knowledgable . will defiantly be using in the future .
work team was short on time while working on a project . pizza was delicious and delivered right on time . 
this is a location i frequent when in pittsburgh . the drinks are standard and prices about the same as other starbucks . nice place to get a drink and sit inside in the cooler months or outside in the warmer weather .
we had a great time at this restaurant . old school and fun atmosphere . the food was truly plentiful and pleasing . the all inclusive menu makes it a pretty good deal . will return to try the linguine with clams !
we came here often while we were in huntersville and enjoyed the atmosphere for game day . i especially loved my shrimp and grits one night . good times .
compared to other places in the city the gelato is definitely sub par ( i had banana and pistachio )  and the prices are more expensive than most . couldn t even finish the whole thing it was so bad .
they were there exactly on time . they fixed the problem in a timely manner and the air conditioner is working like new and has been for the last week . we were pleased with the work done and would use this company again if needed . the couple that we saw were very pleasant and seemed to care about the work they did .
nothing much seems place is going down on service . prices were raised and they removed the free popcorn . wth ?.
they give great service and do their best to accommodate the customer . this store is really convenient with their location as well because it s right down the street from my house so if i ever need any check ups i can just stop by after work . keep up the good work guys !
my girlfriend and i came in for a quick drink as well as an appetizer . she got a red sangria which was over iced with barely anything in the drink . i got the chicken and cheese quesadillas which were practically cold but i ate them because i was famished . i will never come here again .
it s really a convenient place , but the disappointed part is my family doctor lacks of experiences , acts careless and misdiagnoses . basically he missed the best chance to cure it . i was asking him to give me a thoroughly check in my injury since beginning . after three months i am still in pain and not getting better . i did the opposite of what he had said and went to see a specialist . right move . at least the injury is in progress .
this restaurant is amazing . the dumplings are an a . we had the spicy fish in hot pot that blew our minds . also , the taiwanese cabbage was sublime . the food and service are some of the best we have had in any city . pittsburgh is lucky to have this gem .
delicious spot for a quick bite . and . it s next door to my favorite consignment store smarty pants . their yogurt parfait is so , so delish . they are a little pricey but the food quality is comparable . their passion iced tea is perfect too !
so fun , really love sitting at the bar hanging out with crazy drunk locals . the tacos are terrific and the local margarita in a pint glass is the way to go . marisa loves the ceviche too .
my husband and i used to eat here frequently and always had a positive experience . the last several times we have eaten there the experience has been very disappointing . service is poor and slow and all the sushi rolls taste the same .
great service and the boxes are really solid . you can stick labels on the side . it was really easy to stack them up and not worry about it caving in . i saw these guys at the green living show a few year back and they remembered me !
my bf really wanted pizza so we decided to try this place out . the service is terrible and the pizza was the greasiest thing i have ever seen . the combo is a can of soda and nothing else . i am never coming back here again . 
this ice cream shop is awesome . it s so matcha flavors and the employees were so nice to customers . i was really enjoy here .
ok so yes , it appears to be a chain but this is quite good . forget the calories . it s vegas go all in . look at the reviews and photos here on yelp and choose your best option . turkey sandwich is great . mint oreo dessert is fantastic . 
cute setup and delicious ice cream . perfect place to go on a sunny afternoon . their take out boxes and fortune cookies only add to the charm of the old house in downtown phoenix .
i would not come here again . the food offered is the usual buffet menu you d find anywhere . food was warm at best . the one positive i can offer is that the place is clean .
average food for a high price . i had the steak quesadilla . very fatty . my son had a cheese quesadilla . did like it . the tecate pork was dried out .
how lucky to have this place close to my house , i come here often and buy fresh roasted beans as gifts and also make the coffee at home for myself . i am telling you that this is some seriously good coffee . i recommend these guys to other coffee drinkers i know and will continue to do so . great stuff . thanks guys !
we just moved from michigan love doctor mike . he is great with our son , who is a little shy to people he doesn t see everyday . dr mike is pro breast feeding , answers all your questions , and takes the extra time getting to know your kid . we had so many options to choose from when moving to gilbert , i am so happy with our decision !
one of my favorite stores . unique finds . love the restaurant there the turkey sandwich is amazing or that yummy cuban club . i wish checkout could be faster i am sure i would buy morepeople are friendly . love the look of the store as you enter . overall great place for any budget !
stopped in based on the reviews , glad we did . the coyote margaritas are awesome , very nice flavors . food wise , i had the carne machaca dinner which was also very good . service was great and friendly .
lots of choices here and a nice small patio to relax at lunch . i had a turkey sandwich and french fries . delicious and relaxing to eat here .
i m definitely a fan . the atmosphere here is great and the food is delicious and presented beautifully . i am not the biggest beer fan , so i can t comment on that . but really great place ( especially on the weekend ) .
excellent smoked chicken wings . most memorable i ve had in a long time . great craft beer selection . get the growler for r the best deal . unique hot dog selections have been a new experience , ultimately an explosion of flavor . the frog and brutus are my top two dogs . hate to say it , i haven t had the ribs , but heard they are traditional ohio smoke .
i love corned beef sandwiches and pierogis . can you guess what i had for lunch . both were great . 
awesome great place for mma i had great fun time there looking forward to getting back there as soon as my schedule changes.
stopped here while visiting in scottsdale . love this place . classy and i found a classy jacket on sale . very nice staff .
the spaghetti and meatballs is outstanding . my husband ordered the lasagna and inhaled it . good food , service off to a slow start . this place just needs to be discovered !
i ve been eating out way too much lately . this place is another of a long line of awesome food finds for me this month . went in for lunch and i have no idea what i ordered but all of it was good and all of my co workers have been hitting it up repeatedly since . go here , right now and eat tacos .
phenomenal . fresh , healthy , hearty food that is presented beautifully . the pad thai is sauced to perfection with a good amount of spice and veggies . the cheese plate is a meal on its own and a perfect combination of flavors and textures . yola mango smoothie is my favorite snack or meal replacement , not too sweet and really fills you up !
i love this place . small , clean , shop w a friendly staff . lots of color and style selections . its always nice to go somewhere where not only do they do a great job , but they remember your name .
there food is great but organization is a total shit show . they have no idea who is waiting and or who has to be seated . sad because this was really close to my workplace . i ll continue to go to the rainbow location but this location sucks !
highly recommended . these guys were great . fair price for solid work . if your looking for a professional moving company to help make your move easier then you ve found the right company . thanks anthony and nick for helping make my move so smooth !
my husband buys from here so often , i think the sales people know his name lol . m what i love about best buy is that they sales price match . we bought a breville expresso machine that worked great and they price matched it with a amazon price we found.
i finally found a mexican restaurant worth returning to . nice inside and plenty of menu options . do yourself a favor and order a mangonada !
limited selection , and pretty middle of the road as far as flavour .
food options at rio are very limited and there is not much open during the day this vietnamese order at the counter spot ( located in rio s food court )  is one of the few places open for lunch the food here looks less greasy than the deli next door , but the food was below average ( the grilled pork had an okay flavor and decent moisture , but it tasted like it was pre cooked and then simply heated up the egg rolls had an unappetizing color ( no golden brown exterior a bland , greasy and white deep fried shell )  i imagine rio offers free self parking like all the other major hotels and casinos on the strip .
so good . that is all i really can say . the portions are good and worth the price . my belly is always satisfied after a meal there .
had issues with my reverse osmosis called for service and was very pleased . they tested my water to make sure the settings where correct . found that they offer all types of filters for my machine for much less than what i was currently paying for . everyone i had spoken with was very friendly and knowledgeable . i would totally recommend trying them out to any of my friends and family .
really great poutine . best i ve ever had . creative choices and specials , good ingredients , nice big portions , great prices , and a really cool little spot with plenty of tables .
went here on a late night date . the space was a little hard to find but very clean and cozy . however , the service was borderline . terrible . the two guys that alternated waiting on us always slowly sauntered over with the grumpiest expressions on their faces . they seemed genuinely irritated to be serving anyone actually . nevertheless , on to the food . the strawberry themed shaved ice dish was huge and very good but not exactly deserving of the hype that it gets from a lot of my friends . made the mistake of sharing one dish between two people if i were to come back i would definitely bring more people !
this cirque show is my favorite . i have seen it twice and had two different viewpoints . the upper area offers a full view of the show , while sitting up close makes you feel like you re apart of the show . the songs cirque picked are perfect . between the acrobats , stunts , dance moves and crowd interaction . i m moved . this show will have you falling in love with the beatles all over again !
really great authentic mexican food . try the cochinita pibil and the birria soup . really nice !
very nice ambience and fair prices . the entre was delicious but the sides were cold . will try again since other five friends raved about their meals .
i really enjoy their hot hk milk tea . it is smooth and the flavor intense . i ve ordered their cold version before but it just tastes really watered down . i would definitely recommend the hot hk milk tea !
i m not sure why this location has such a low rating . i am pleased everytime i come here . the food is good , the servers are friendly and the restaurant is clean . what more do you need ?.
one of the best mexican restaurants in vegas . and there isnt many to choose from . fantastic food . fantastic service . we ll keeping coming back.
jade palace is our favorite arizona chinese restaurant . we are always warmly greeted by the owner , manager and staff . the menu is varied and innovative . selections include scallops , sea bass , pork , beef , chicken , shrimp and vegetarian dishes . we have never been disappointed and look forward to dining here often . you will not be disappointed .
i manage a medical practice and have to interact with specialty pharmacies like briova on behalf of our patients . i constantly hear horror stories and much frustration from patients who are forced by their insurance companies to use briova . one patient told me that he would rather go off his medication rather than deal with them . i would not recommend them to anyone who has a choice .
can t say enough about this place everything we tried on the menu was good . you can hangout with buddy s and chill or date night with bae . looking forward to coming back on thursday r b night .
i play music in a band , and when it s time for a gig , i swing by lawrence for a hair cut . he is an artist , a creator , and i always leave with my hair looking cool . oh , also very affordable .
delicious . almost went to p . f . chang s but decided to take a chance and really glad we did . not only is the food great but the service is as well . after our meal the owner came out and made sure everyone was happy and we were . i recommend the shrimp fried rice , salt pepper prawns and the kung pow prawns . we will definitely be back .
on a recent holiday in chandler , i was fortunate enough to sample whataburger s bacon and egg taquitos for breakfast , which seem more like burritos where i m from but whatever . i appreciate the server bringing the condiment tray to the table . make sure to ask for some salsa , which they shrewdly keep hidden under the counter . that s some good stuff , man !
my husband and i had a great dinner here . they have the best steak and their house potatoes are awesome . great neighborhood steakhouse . i highly recommend this restaurant !
thank you so much . what a headache monday morning can be especially when you lock your only set of keys in your car . quick and efficient and took care of my problem . i am so grateful and won t think of another company ever again !
hands down best bbq ever in my life . all homemade food . absolutely delicious . highly recommend . 
so funny and fun . we loved this show . he brings people up on stage , does tricks with them , and gives them prizes . his magic tricks blew our mind .
really good place . the bbq is really testy and service is great . if you are in phoenix , arizona and want to try a good bbq restaurant this is the place to go . believe me it s great.
found this place on yelp . my boyfriend is always looking for new sushi places for us to try . this is a tiny hole in the wall but man is it a gem . the ahi poke is the best i ve had yet . sushi rolls were loaded and just delicious . we will be back for sure . the young lady who waited the tables always made sure your drink was full and that your food was good and timely . yum !
sushi was very good . authentic , good location . my fiancee doesn t normally enjoy tuna sashimi , but she devoured theirs and is still talking about it . if it s a hot day , sit near the bar to get some a c , as the further from the bar area you get the hotter the room is when busy .
my husband and i always wanted to try indian style food and decided to check this place out because of the reviews . unfortunately it was a huge disappointment . i think the seasoning isnt for everyone . we thought everything had a sweet flavor that didnt sit well with us . the place was clean and had a cool set up though . if you like indian spices you may like it .
if you are looking for a fancy steak restaurant , then go here . went here a while back for an event and hands down it was a good experience , enjoyed the atmosphere inside the restaurant and the view of their kitchen while the chef cooks for you , very delicious and fancy . they also have a balcony outside with tables , just make sure to call ahead since they are busy .
i love this bar in old town . the outdoor space is fantastic and spacious . the multiple bars cut down on wait times to get a drink . with a great number of tv s , you can almost always find the game you want to watch . friday night is definitely the night to go if you want a large , diverse crowd . saturday night is fun for just relaxing with friends to get drinks .
my first time to this diner . what a lovely reason to go downtown calgary on a chilly saturday am to meet a friend for breakfast . despite the fact that my friend missed her bus and was very late , the staff took remarkable care of me , ensuring my coffee cup was always full . they even asked if i wanted something to hold me , i . e . , toast , until my friend arrived . delicious savory mediterranean omelette , yummy hash browns and fresh fruit bowl . warm and inviting ambiance . definitely coming back here !
had jerk shrimp with grits . jerk sauce was too salty . it had cinnamon or cardamon that did not fit a jerk profile . no bite to the sauce . wont have again . grits were great . try something else another time . wife had eggs benedict . she liked them very much .
fantastic grooming . everyone is so nice , professional and very clean . my fur baby looked and smelled great . he was also in a great mood so i can tell they were very good to him during his grooming . i would definitely recommend bringing your fur baby to cageless grooming !
great school . love the teachers , it is an extension of family at this location . compassionate teachers who go above and beyond in teaching the children developmental milestone .
fast fix jewelry offers honest customer care . reliable , professional cleaning and repair . recommend this business in the scottsdale fashion mall . thanks . nc.
amazing place to live . the staff kicks butt . they go the extra mile for you all the time and the maintenance crew is stellar . it s like a huge family here . 
wonderful atmosphere and beautiful staff . well informed and geeks about coffee . madison is never short of authentic coffee shops but it s the ones that actually care that stay . i hope this milwaukee based shop does . indie but classy . definitely recommend .
hands down the best indian food i have eaten . i had just moved from india and i was craving indian food . so my roommates took me to this place and i felt like i was home . good paper dosas , the masala dosa is a home run and try the almond halva you have to ask for it . it s called badam halva .
we had an amazing experience using calanit for a networking event in vegas ( we are based out of nyc )  . she was very thorough and communicative . we would definitely use her again in the future for all of our event needs .
this place is awesome if you re looking for entertainment . pool tables , corn bags , shuffle board , darts , comfy seating . it s bar food with a good set up . i recommend ypu try it !
my boy and i stopped in for a quick dinner and were pleasantly surprised . the morris ramen was great and the buns ( beef and pork )  were very good . plus , we both liked the feel of the place . we sat at the bar and watched all the magic happen .
recommended by a peruvian friend . chicken , french fries and spicy sauce are all good . just wish the mango juice can be improved . will visit next time !
dont get me wrong , i m a beatles fan , i just didn t quite know all the songs they played , i enjoyed them all nonetheless my fav act is probably when the telephone booth came out and they all trampolined back and forth and across using the telephone booth also , the bald guy in grey , aka dr . evil coined by my friend luke l , stole the show everytime he came out , i d only zero in on him and no one else he s just so dazzling and captivating .
pretty good takeout food at a fair price bar and outdoor seating area looked nice.
another great job by these great techs . my granite chipped , i m not sure how , but the tech repaired it . i can t see the repair . thanks guys . great job !
i eat sushi about twice a month locally . we went to vegas on a business trip and decided to try culinary art sushi and selected the social house . i can t believe how insanely good sushi can get . every dish was very , very good . the sushimi was super fresh . the saki s are blowout good too . happy camper .
went here once and will not return . lazy teenagers were running the restaurant , and my burger was so undercooked that i took it home and microwaved it .
the best . so knowledgeable and helpful and they really go the extra mile to make sure you get what you need and that you are safe !
best indian food in town hands down never had a bad experience the owner gill is super nice will come up and greet you at the table.
prices are higher than amc , but pretty good theater.
go here for a real cup of coffee . not that sugary , watered down crap that chain coffee shops sell . this is my favorite coffee shop in phoenix . i go here at least once a week , and it never disappoints .
unique , delicious food . great beer selection . quick and friendly service . definitely coming back next time i m in phoenix .
had the beef pho noodle . as good as any others that i have eaten . the noodle was really soft and the soup tasty . the portion was good sized . when you collect the food , there are cups and jugs of ice water , so there is no need to pay for water for the meal.
food was really superior compared to other buffets . the sushi chefs were having trouble keeping up with the busy crowd . the sushi was fresh and delicious . the clam chowder was to die for . come during the week so you can be seated right away . 
these guys are the best . moving stinks but they make it easy and convenient . and this was the cleanest truck i have ever been in . brian , was so helpful when i had to keep the truck a second day due to the storage facility locking me out ( fail )  . he bryson and jaret all assisted me throughout my messy move and enjoyed a good laugh with me . professional , busy for a reason and i highly recommend their service and will use them again !
some of the bartenders make up rules for coupons and whatnot on the fly . my boyfriend just ordered an old fashioned and said it was sweet . it s whiskey . i got a fuzzy navel and it just tasted like watered down juice . ugh .
this was my first experience with an indian store in las vegas . loved it , selves are well stocked and layed out well . fresh products were all in good shape . i will return soon !
getting a dark roast coffee using the express lane . the staff are courteous and efficient in processing my order . everything you expect from tim hortons is available here . seating however is available down in the food court .
owner is amazing and sweet . outrageous flavors saturdays and sundays she carries savory flavors . today: red bell peppers , roasted garlic , and pesto pizza . delicious would definitely come back next time i m here .
i think i just come here just for their meat jun since it s hard to look for a place here in town with good meat jun . i love that you have a variety of sides to choose from when eating here . the noodles , sweet potato and bean sprouts are super delish . the portions are huge too !
another great night with lise . yes it s spelled lise . she always bust her butt to make sure all guest are happy and well taken care of . pt s needs more positive people like her . way to go girl !
so far , felt a more beginners studio . not really for advance or professionals . gear towards ballroom dancers .
a . maz . ing . on time , great skill , works fast , pleasant , eye for design , helpful and so much more !
there is nothing healthy about this place but it is everything yummy . even if you aren t a huge hot dog lover , you can still appreciate the flavors that are added to their hot dog creations from their asian fusion offerings to their interpretation of american favorites like a philly cheesesteak . sauces taste fresh as well as the ingredients , and not soggy at all . i do not recommend trying to eat this in your car because you need to mimick the guy fiere hunch and bite to avoid a mess . now , i just wish they had another location closer to henderson .
corey cleaned our carpets , tile and windows today . very friendly and reliable . always answered my calls and emails right away . showed up on time and finished when he said he would . thumbs up .
great martinis at a great price . modern atmosphere . friendly staff . good service . i am very pleased with this place .
i love cpk , but in this location the customer service is poor and the waiters are very rude and not friendly.
i came in with my bf to get a hair cute so i decided to get mani and pedi and hair blow out and honestly i hade a blast all the girls are so nice and make me feel very comfortable and bf was on the barber so he hade a good time too i definitely recommend this place i will for sure be coming back .
staff here is pretty good me and my mom come here for pedicures an i come for a brow wax as well they do beautiful flower but make sure you tell them specific what you like . i wanted a simple daisy and they didn t understand and gave me a pretty big flower but i just wanted something simple . they give amazing massages definitely recommend coming here .
food was average . interesting choices and attentive service . portions were a little small served in smaller dishes to make it seem filled . will try them again .
went to this location and the waitress completely ignored me , she spent more time chit chatting with her fellow employees then taking my order , i reported her to the manegar and he seemed to be completely clueless and had no idea what i was talking about , i give olive garden two stars because the food is slightly better then anything at mcdonalds .
nice park . gets very crowded at the playgrounds put your child in bright colors clothing and keep an eye out . not a lot of trees but a nice shelter to sit under . really nice soccer field and good restrooms .
best pho i have been able to find in charlotte . very traditional , super tasty . the exterior is pretty ghetto but they ve done a good job transforming the interior to be more inviting . portions are exceptionally big , most times it ll be two meals for me . wait staff is usually attentive and fast . occasionally there will be a small language barrier if you want something explained on the menu . but hey , it s a traditional joint , what do you expect . highly recommend it .
this is a good park , its small but fast . there is an anti graffiti coating on the concrete that makes for a unique surface to ride on . i wouldn t go as far to say it is slick but it takes less lateral force to throw wheel slides and they go a bit further . watch out there are kids , but don t sweat it kids have more resiliency than you d think .
we decided to give this place another try . we ordered a pizza and it turned out pretty good . the dough bread tasted fresh and it didn t have an old aroma texture to it this time . thanks !
terrible , soggy bread plain as hell thats why they put so much nacho cheese on it to disguise that bland meat.
our service in las vegas sucked . guy what is the deal here . we didnt love our food like we expected , could have been part of the fact our waitress was so rude to us . thumbs down.
food is very good and the price is reasonable but the service tends to be on the slow side . so don t go there if you are in a hurry . be ready to spend time .
great service fast and friendly . i will totally be back if im in the area !
i just sent my son to buy me a carne asada for my husband and believe me . i have seen bad food here in vegas , but this one took the cake , the meat was so black , it was like petrified , stuffed with some limp lettuce . nasty slop !
this place is more than a dog wash . they have it dialed in as far as food , suppliments and toys . cathy is a true animal lover . she helped me get my bulldogs allergies under control . he loves his purvita grain free food . we love you guys !
i love this dunkin donuts location . they are so much faster than many others . great service and they don t burn my wraps like the one on crismon .
great experience car shopping at berge mazda . damon took care of us without the high pressure you usually find in car sales , which i appreciated , and i wasn t treated differently because i m a woman . it was fairly quick , got what i wanted for my trade in , and i m very happy with my new mazda !
grumpy barista . very curt and dismissive . didn t get a chance to order a pastry because she rang me up too fast . is the opposite of upsell downsell . i was obviously looking for a treat . two bad visits in a row . too many other choices to come back . very different from my first experience . the owner lady , who is always pleasant , made me an iced americano i still think about . never been duplicated by her staff .
the food here is always amazing . the variety is one of the best things about the menu . the only drawback is no reservations and you can end up waiting a long time at peak hours on the weekends . cheesecake selection is great and will make the end of the meal special .
i love this place i get the same everytime curry shrimp with extra curry sauce and chicken fried rice . quick service , clean and friendly .
amazing experience . massage was top notch deep tissue by coco . lee the owner goes above and beyond for his guests . i will be bringing my husband back later this week.
great barbershop , jesse is a beast with the clippers and they have great customer service.
we have lived her for a period of time . i would like to say that staff is on top of it . call in am with a maintenance issue , by the end of the day maintenance is completed . ty is such a sweet lady , will listen and will get things done . very organized . thanks to all of the staff .
these folks are always super helpful . we had an incident with fed ex not delivering a package on time and within two weeks we had a full refund .
order food: you can t go wrong with anything on the menu . they always have a daily special that is a good deal . our favorites are: chicken pita , grilled chicken chef salad , greek salad , fish sandwich , and to splurge the pita burger ( watch out this one has a lot of calories )  . atmosphere: you order at the front and the staff brings the food out to you . sometimes the service can be slow ( you might get your food before your drinks )  but overall really happy with this location . stay away from monday nights unless you have children because the balloon guy is there and its kid central !
it basically looks like every other hooters out there . the wings are pretty good but again i m not a huge pub fan . i think it s worth a try .
nikko . in a word , amazing . honestly the best haircut and beard trim i have ever had . in addition to being incredibly talented nikko is also very easy to talk to and makes the whole experience enjoyable . if you are looking for a great barber look no further .
it s an okay place , not much to do here . some cheap boutiques selling mostly junk . a rexall and grocery store .
my niece plays baseball at mcqueen park and we were in search of lunch after her game and stumbled upon this cute place . service was great , friendly and attentive . we all had burgers which actually came out cooked how we had ordered . thumbs up . i think they re pretty new but they definitely have already got service and quality food down . great find . 
best bake shop in the pittsburgh area . home made and family owned . this place is awesome and the staff is wonderful .
food was ok . not awesome , but good . waitress really friendly . i will come back and next time will try other vegetarian food . menu for veg food is long .
our very favorite restaurant in the lakewood rocky river area . the jalapeno stuffed pretzals dipped in the beer cheese soup is awesome and so is the johnny mac and cheese . highly recommend.
service and food were horrible had cheese sticks with no cheese in them wings were cold i would rather go to a fast food restaurant then go to this place not impressed at all .
love walking into a boutique clothing store knowing that the clothes will actually fit my figure . it s like having your own closet to pick and choose from . i was also glad to be able to see this place in the flesh.
this is probably my favorite store such great knowledgeable employee s torie and tonya thanks for your help.
holy crap . get their queso fundido with carne asada and mushrooms . it s so freaking good . 
what a great place . loved every thing about it , to the cute decor , the excellent service from gina , the fabulous food . my husband had the la wrap i had the club ( which has nice thick fresh sourdough )  both with the sweet potato fries yum . with our meals we had the black butte porter and fish tale amber beers which were excellent as well . found this place on yelp and will definitely be back next time we re in nv !
cbw westlake is super . they have convenient hours , separate dogs by size and activity level , have cameras in the play areas , and associates who obviously love dogs . so glad to have found this place !
to say this business does not pride themselves on customer service is an understatement . they have zero customer service . once they get your money . its all down hill from their . i have been waiting for a refund for them overcharging me for over two weeks . i submitted a complaint to there customer care dept and no one has even responded to my complaint . if you get directed to their site to purchase tickets . run !
hate waiting in the long line but i have to say it s well worth it . we have been to the one in la and the food here at cosmo it s the same . tried the slut this time , if you love mashed potato and poached egg you will love this . it is served with a few slices of baguette bread .
amazing sushi . felt like i was in nyc not phx . very fun atmosphere . best sushi i have had in phx . must get the oh my god roll !
food was great but seating was a slight issue . the place is small and you might end up waiting a little bit before seating .
this was the most ridiculous thing of my life . not only were they an hour late delivering my food but the delivery dude was a complete asshole . it s not my responsibility to be your gps . i gave him the hotel the address he still couldn t find the damn place . so let s review , extremely late , douchebag attitude , oh yeah , the fucker didn t even have any change so he straight robbed me . absolutely unacceptable . shady place . shady people .
very good lunch today . had the pork belly small plate , wife had the b g burger . service was great , food was excellent , we look forward to coming back for dinner sometime soon !
just the right flavors for ramen . authentic and pleasant taste . will be going again . menu is a little work in progress as they have just opened . keeping my hopes high . they torch their chashu here !
i liked it more than i thought i would , but in the end this place is just bowling for people who are too fancy to bowl . the environment and games definitely are designed for the scottsdale and gilbert crowd of suburbanites with too much time and money on their hands . surprisingly , food and drink prices weren t ridiculous . and some of the grub was pretty tasty .
apteka is seriously all around the best vegan joint in the burgh . great food , great drinks , greater staff .
great service , excellent food , enjoying lunch outside . you can t beat downtown phoenix for a great big city experience .
staff at the cafeteria told me that a certain item did not contain dairy so i ordered it for my son , who has a dairy allergy . he loved it so i went downstairs to grab and frozen package of the same food and it turned out it had dairy . not cool . little buddy had a rough night . won t be back to the cafeteria .
best sandwiches in town and best staff . the customer service here is best you will find . very authentic philly experience.
ms . q is truly anointed with her hands . very professional , polite and friendly . love her works.
great service . i will say i was impressed by contact from the manager letting me know they changed their fries to fresh cut . i gave them another try and definitely did not disappoint . i appreciate both the message from the business owner but the great food and service . a must go if you re in scottsdale .
des les premiers pas dans ce bar , j ai su que j allais l aimer . pourquoi . surement parce que le cadre a l audace d etre a la fois epure et chaleureux . les lumieres tamisees , la musique d ambiance qui ne vient pas perturber les conversations . des espaces avec tables basses ou hautes , tout confort . une carte qui donne envie et des cocktails qui ne decoivent pas . j ai deguste mon verre en me disant qu il faudrait que je revienne , que j y emmene mes amis , que c etait vraiment un endroit parfait pour atterrir apres le travail un vendredi soir . gros coup de coeur !
absolutely amazing wings . damn good mediterranean pizza( the crust is delicious )  , and highly recommend the greek salad . if you re super hungry and dine in service is fast friendly every time .
my first time using sassy s . a great experience . i recommend them highly . i had a problem adjusting to my new glasses and needed to come see them . while they were closed for year end inventory they welcomed me to come in and they would work with me . so very much appreciated that hospitality and working with me through the situation .
try the vegetarian tacos no joke , they re really good . i m not super keen on really sweet drinks , but the yoga margarita hits the spot .
i ordered from here through uber eats my pad thai was absolutely delicious and a large portion . i hope to visit the restaurant in person and try more items off the menu !
aron s tree service were very polite and professional . they are very affordable . they arrived a little early and got right to work . they were quick and safe . they cleaned up and hauled out the tree trimmings . i highly recommend them .
this is by far my favorite thai restaurant . it s a little hidden treasure of a restaurant . i have no complaints whatsoever on anything . the food and the thai tea were delicious and stellar customer service .
we have tried upper end resorts , other pet sitters and our experiences with them all were way less than advertised , or even recommended by our vet . susan was so busy this time of year in arizona , but she provided her own husband for us that , in and of itself was outstanding . we have two spoiled rotten rescues of dubious breed and everything went seamlessly . we would enthusiastically refer pampered pets and plants to the pickiest friends we have . they even watered our plants by hand since our drip has been eaten by bunnies and rescue puppies and we didn t even ask . nancy and bob.
this is a great , hidden gem . i ordered the pei muscles and pan seared scallops , both of which were very good . they have a great list of local beers on tap as well as many other options . i think the upstairs bar area is super cool . there were a lot of great people in the crowd on this thursday night .
had a dinner party here with a large group for a birthday . claire helped me set up a family style dinner where we were brought out a mix from the menu so everyone got to try everything . the food was excellent as well as the service . they were very helpful in accommodating our large group . we will be back !
there are very few companies that actually care about their customers and this is one of them . tosha tanner reached out to me shortly after this review and told me that the complaints were addressed and made sure that it didn t happen again to other guests . never have i had anyone care so much to go to extra lengths to set things right , specially not a company large . customer service really go a long way and this proves it . thank you , tosha .
mary was amazing the best massage ever . i will definitely be visiting again real soon.
love this place . used to work close by and went everyday . now i have withdrawals : ) .
very successful hernia surgery . easy recovery with minimal pain . had both groins and belly button done at the same time which only needed three tiny incisions . super nice guy and and seems to really care which is sometimes hard to find here in vegas . i was referred by my wife s trainor and fellow gym rat and i would recommend him as well to anyone who wants to get through surgery without having a huge amount of down time or pain .
it s a great step back in time . the place is a romantic diner ( believe it or not )  . i also liked it because most of the people in there like to dress , if you know what i mean . having great drinks didn t hurt . if you ever come to vegas . check it out .
very delicious steak on the barbi i had with my lovely wife . would recommend to all this establishment .
i was pleasantly surprised at this store . everyone was friendly and knew where everything was . staffing levels were appropriate and their return policy is excellent .
great pizza , quick service , friendly staff , good prices , large portions . we ll definitely be back !
i really love this place . we had our company christmas dinner there , and numerous dinners among friends . each time the food was good and service was prompt .
we love our new shades . tim did a great job of helping us choose the right ones . the measurement and installation was perfect and done quickly . we highly recommend this business .
my favourite supermarket . lots of well priced , fresh produce and a glorious range of useful healthy asian products that are great for cooking and snacking . they re very nice here and i m really glad they didn t install do it yourself checkouts and leave one cashier like at metro downstairs .
i want to update this review because they have gone over the top to make us feel happy . our washer machine broke down and they came in and put a brand new one instantly . really happy with my decision to renew the contract for another year . 
really good place to eat but really rude cashier . i asked her if we can split the check between two cards and she said no give one card and pay each other later . she made things so difficult and was very unprofessional . great place to eat tho .
not much to add to other reviews great place to chill out and play some old school games for spare change . this is probably going to become a regular stop for me . and a top recommendation to friends who visit . this place is maintained by volunteers who donate their profits to charity ( or so i was told by a couple of operators )  . freaking awesome . be sure to try pinball circus , super fun , one of a kind game ( only two built )  that never made it to production but one is here . the relaxalator over by the vending , try it out . no entrance fee , just put quarters in the machines !
did a take out from here for my hubby to eat . i got lobster omelet . pretty decent . but a bit pricy . but people are so sweet .
this starbucks has really upped their afternoon game . i m usually there in the mornings as i work right across the parking lot . the morning crew is still as wonderful as ever and always remember s my order as well as my boss : )  shoutout to my girls over there . love ya . what propelled me to update my review was the service i received on friday . i had a super long day at work and wanted an iced green tea to make everything better . they were attentive , swift and super friendly . i really appreciated it after a crazy day . you guys rock !
i love this place . i m vegetarian and they have a lot of choices for me . my fiance who is not vegan loves all the food here . amazing happy hour . get the cheese crisp . great margaritas and beer choices . the restaurant itself is beautiful and is wonderfully dark inside to keep away from the heat on a hot day . bartenders are awesome along with the waitstaff .
i ordered my daughters wedding cake from joe of las vegas custom cakes and was so pleased with our cake water fall and all and flowers so pretty . it was made exactly as we discussed . it was just beautiful delicious . jd set it up and he is terrific at what he does . thank you to your crew they are very talented . the other desserts we ordered were also fabulous ( shooters , cookies , cannolis , cake pops )  just wonderful elegant tasty . thank you again joe it was a pleasure working with you !
portions are huge . food spot on . we ordered the ribs with fried polenta , truffle fries with wontons tacos as appetizer . we were not disappointed .
lived up to it s kitsch vibe . loved the decor . sat in the bar . played video poker . one eye on baseball game . other on the floating fireplace . ordered sampler and exotic drinks from james ( great bartender )  . wait staff was attentive friendly . did not dine in the restaurant . bar only . high marks for a different walk back in time vegas experience.
great place for lebanese and mediterranean food . family run atmosphere , and all freshly prepared . the hummus is tasty and creamy , everything from the grill is fantastic . i try to order a different entree on every visit , tried the lamb last time , by far that is my favorite .
absolutely amazingggg . i got the fair fax sandwich . twice . also tried the slut . everything is so flavorful and cooked perfectly . went with a group of people and everyone loved what they ordered . don t let the line turn you away , it s worth it !
these guys had no clue that they have happy hour shakes . even though it s advertised . total mess . no clue . had to call neighboring sonic.
absolutely amazing . emerald chicken quesadilla , jade red burrito , jerk fried rice , and black beans . if you do not know what to get , ask for samples . wish it was closer to tempe scottsdale but make the drive out there you will not be disappointed !
definite going back . food was great . service was great , no complaints . in a bad area , but it s so homey inside you can t even tell . worth it .
great food , drinks and ambiance . enjoy the rooftop in the summer but try to reserve in advance during those months !
i took my class to the clark county museum for a field trip . it was smooth and enjoyable from start to finish . you get to really see and touch pieces of local history . i d highly recommend taking the drive out to boulder highway and spending the day .
want to make st . patty s day an everyday option , without the intense partying etc . any irish beer or whiskey you can think of , within reason , is here . location in the theatre district , this local pub has the irish flair and casual ambiance that is great for stopping in before or after a play , or even just to stop in because you were in the area like me . they accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating as well . we only had drinks while we were here , but the staff was very friendly and attentive .
amazing organic juices , smoothies , and bowls . great quality , tastes great good service and really clean place .
i have used this property for years . every time i have an issue lisa does her best to accommodate or resolve the issue .
a charming , small restaurant in a central location . i had wanted to try this place forever and i m so glad i finally did . absolutely wonderful food and top notch service . go when it s not busy so that you get a good seat . you absolutely must try to cenpho press panini . apple slices , bacon , and creamy brie complement eachother so nicely !
supporting my husband and all our vets . happy hour drinks are cheap and entertainment on point . tonight with karaoke lol.
amazing will definitely eat here every time i m in the area . great service friendly people and amazing food . me and my wife split the city sampler had sausage , bbq , brisket and turkey and oh my it was all amazing . some of the best i ve ever had . also comes with great texas toast and two sides , we had green beans and baked beans both great .
omg . so happy and shocked to see my stylist from la here . george you are my go to hair stylist in vegas from now until forever . you re the best . 
one of the best places to eat in paris hotel . i love their savory crepes . 
i love bocho sushi , as their food is quite good , and their staff is wonderful . ramen all day , for me . wooh !
another win for this place . miranda , who helped us through a very difficult time , is no longer here but thank goodness for nate . you re wonderful nate thank you for the entertainment with the awesome food . we like you even though you re a ducks fan .
meat dept is deplorable . they sold frozen meat , actually with frost on it . i do not have any confidence that the meat is fresh despite what date they had on the label . i believe the state food inspectors should review this fry s location . 
great appetizers and brewery food and amazing beers here . while this doesn t have the same feel as the san diego original location , the unique upper floor corner location is great for people watching . service was very very attentive , which was great , and the happy hour pricing was an awesome touch . although there are many non chain places on mill avenue , this is a great more adult location to watch college students acting stupid and to have delicious food and drinks .
i love this place . they have the best menu for a burger place . the healthy choices are a great option and the staff is amazing . i will definitely be back many time to try all the different items on their menu .
not good . the all you can eat fish fry is given to u in scraps after the first serving . just a bunch of grease . 
why go anywhere else . byob , intimate , creative local food . housemade charcuterie . paw paw mustard . house aged beef , beautiful chicken pot pie , lamb you can cut with a stare . i ve never been disappointed and you won t be either . great value.
this place is most definitely my go to place for something quick , easy , and healthy . i m addicted to the variety of things they have here especially if i m cutting back on red meat and pork . they have some many food items made of poultry and seafood . my husband loves trying out different pasta sauces and snacks here . can t go wrong with anything here .
best sushi place in phoenix . there has not been a roll that i ve tried that i do not like . everything is fresh and made to order . friendly staff , must try kind of a place .
lifetime fitness in mississauga is one of the nicest fitness facilities in southern ontario . i ve been a member with my wife and kids for almost a year and will continue to be as long as it stays this way . amazing facility . great customer service . always clean . countless activities , swimming lessons for kids . family friendly but also a gym rats fantasy .
not montreal s only cookbook and food lit specialty bookstore , but certainly its best . a large collection of books in english and french ( but mostly english )  + a full service kitchen makes appetite for books an ideal location for culinary book launches and cooking classes , and they don t hold back . check out their website for a complete list of upcoming events , and act fast if you see something you like their series of events is very , very popular .
everything was delicious , i had the jerk pork sandwich and my husband had the moroccan chickpea vegetable stew . price very reasonable and service was excellent .
delicious brunch with huge portion and great prices . very friendly service as well . awesome brunch place in markham area . strongly recommended.
got a large pizza for delivery and it took almost two hours . on a monday night . pizza was cold . had to call back twice to see where our pizza was . the person taking the order wouldn t even let me finish the card number and i had to repeat myself several times . awful service . deserves zero stars .
my experience was overall a good one . i saw the nurse practioner . lynn fiore . she was very personable and efficient . i have no complaints and am sorry to see that there were a few very negative ones posted here .
this place is awasome i eat ceviche el patron and yes they take a wile why cus is real mexican sinaloa style food take a wile in the mean time order some beer and wait for the greatest food the lady about the rice that s how it is get see food don t ask for a hamburger if you like mexican american food with all the mexican chesse shit this is not your place sea food fresh and soo good if your allergic to guacamole don t go there cus all or food got guacamole aguacate camarones culichi are the best . 
these guys are great . had a problem with our pool , saw their truck in the neighborhood and called their number . the owner was incredibly responsive and sent a technician out immediately . technician was very thorough . office called next day to be sure issue was fully resolved and pool working normally . great experience .
brought two kinds of dog food and a wet supplement for my two dogs staying , but they still charged me for a whole bag of dog food for a two night stay . i would have liked to have been notified before they made additional charges , and to not find out when i picked them up.
the al pastor had the perfect balance of sweet and heat . i will definitely have it again probably two . i also had the corn , mexican street style , the paprika made the corn seem even sweeter . the staff was friendly and accommodating . i guess they just needed to see a smiling face to prompt them to offer assistance . taco y taco will be on my lunch list favorites !
no one wears gloves when preparing any food item . too noisy , and dirty , will not go there again at all . you cannot talk to anyone .
this is a super animal friendly establishment . i always bring my cat here for hair cuts and soft paw nail caps . they usually are able to get me in next day and do a great job . i may be the only person bringing their cat in as it s mostly dog focused , but the groomers are still great and willing to accommodate my cat .
a very clean and energetic office . staff is quite competent and a pleasure to deal with . i would not hesitate to recommend stockton dermatology . very happy my dealings with them .
this place is so good . still drooling over the smokin style sauce . had the crawfish bowl , so delicious and even the corn was the best i ve had . also got king crab legs with drawn butter . cooked perfectly . it was the best meal i had in vegas and we ate at some great restaurants on the strip !
pizza not only taste bad have the cheese is on the side they obviously turn the pizza sideways their well done french fries turned out raw would not recommend.
went to the ballantyne location saturday night , first time we have been to city barbecue the food was really good , we had the ribs with mac n cheese and bbq beans . the service was good staff was friendly and very attentive . we will definitely be visiting again .
just now had a great time . played some dodgeball with a bunch of others , rockclimbed , and played gladiator over the foam pit . ashley and nicole were awesomesauce . they helped us with our check in and on the rock climbing wall , thanks girls !
great service , well worth the price . amazing attention to detail . they really treat you well here !
the rain massage by hannah was really wonderful and memorable and i still talk about it . i waited much to long to use up my gift certificate balance , it won t happen again !
although i haven t been back to o i , i was contacted by a fox rep and they were very courteous and made things right after my bad experience . i go to blanco and culinary dropout frequently and will probably try north this time around . thanks fox !
breakfast was yummy . the ham steak was juicy . eggs were cooked perfectly with cheddar cheese . the pancakes had a pretty good taste but a bit tough , i didn t finish them . but hubby loved his corned beef hash and the home fries potatoes were cooked and seasoned very well . ww will be back for more . great service and quick with food service !
i go here at least once a week for lunch . great staff , great food and great prices . i can not say enough about brien and his awesome staff . julie and all the chefs create great dishes .
typical ruth chris and any other big steak and big side dish place . not an attractive location . we are better off that it is closed .
this is one of our local pet stores . the staff here are wonderful and they have an excellent selection of anything you d need . the other thing that is great is that they have a little self wash doggy wash .
went here after a trip to the zoo , the burgers are delicious . tried the bayou burger and i will definitely be back .
this has been my go to place for thai . it is decorated very classy without trying to hard . it is always clean , and the service is great . the food is very tasty and fresh . i have become a regular here.
service effroyable alors que le restaurant etait vide . bouffe ok pour ce genre d endroit . prix raisonnable . definitivement tres moyen !
had an awesome waffle for breakfast . the maple and bacon . not a very thick waffle but it was delicious and i was satisfied . friend of mine had the elvis one with peanut butter bacon and bananas . loved it as well . a great find . 
everything at this place met expectations . we had chicken wings and mac cheese burger . yum . if you are in vegas you should fof sure stop here.
the customer service team and stylists at this great clips are quite helpful . they are very respectful , ask key probabing questions and do an good job at cutting my hair . the price ia very affordable . the atmosphere is quite positive . dawn who cut , washed , and styled my hair did a great job . i highly recommend dawn . thank you !
this isn t the least expensive place to grab lunch but it s certainly one of the most delicious lunches you can have . i think larger portions would be more enticing since you are paying a premium price for fast vegan food . that being said , it is fast and it is a great , healthy lunch spot !
this place is rather overpriced , the mediocre food isn t bad but only marginally better than say thai express . friendly waiter though , respectful and pleasant . decor is nice enough .
popped in for late night drinks and a bite to eat . though it was busy the food was terrific and service was great . nice atmosphere !
as a long time regular , i am still blown away by the level of customer service i receive during every visit . i feel like i am going to catch up with friends who just so happen to provide some of the most incredible coffee this city has to offer . and the mastermind behind those delicious crepes is more like a food wizard than a chef , and is without a doubt one of the nicest humans on the planet . you will only be cheating yourself to not experience all that crepe bar has to offer .
i ve been to many different ice cream snow cone places but snoh by far is the best one yet . unique style . from the customer service , flavors , toppings , and even the vibe is awesome . i recommend anyone who hasn t tried to give it a go and maybe play some jenga while you enjoy a nice unique shaved ice of your choice !
typically uncrowded thai restaurant in a strip mall with food that is surprisingly good . large portions .
sent me home in pain with infection only gave me antibiotics after i asked , no pain pills he said i d be ok , ended up in urgent care where a gpmd gave me correct antibiotic , and ibu and narco , still had faith so i tried to reschedule waited week and half for him to get home from vacation now he refuses to see me , horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible , avoid at all cost ,.
the toppings on the pizza were good but the crust was super soggy which i disliked alot . the meatballs were blah the sauce was too acidity in my opinion my son didnt even eat it . there a place by where i live ( in long beach , california )  called pieology( so thats what im comparing it to )  . that place is perfection every time thin and crispy . tho whole pizza . not just the crust . i dont think i would eat there again.
huge portions , fantastic service and the best buttermilk pancakes i ve ever had . perfectly crisp on the outside but soft , thick and cakey on the inside .
this gym is terrible . much of the equipment is either broken or not setup ( including any of the fun features they try to sell you when joining )  . a little cleaning of the equipment that is functional wouldn t hurt .
my deep tissue massage with yaret was the best i have ever had . she was amazing . very friendly staff and happy to see you : ) .
i usually get the italian ( sometimes half instead of whole )  with a drink and cole slaw . it s really yummy . definitely more meat in a sub than i m used to and the vinegar with oil is a great mix with the meats .
amazing food . so many choices , it was late afternoon place was packed so service was little slow but overall good place to visit if you are in the city , will be back .
always one of my fave places to visit when in town awesome signature drinks , great food , and rich kim is very hospitable . recommended highly . 
this place is heaven for people who like old , weird junk . i m one of those people . i could browse goat feather s emporium for hours . it was a breath of fresh air after spending some time in las vegas .
fantastic middle eastern food . our first time eating here , the shawarma and combo plates are generous and amazing tasting . we love the baba ghanouj and the fantastic desserts . best falafel i have had in ny , la , or also great customer service . we will be back .
remarkable customer service . my husband i went for my birthday , the entire staff wished me happy birthday , our server was very knowledgeable recommended great dishes . they provided a happy birthday dessert even took a picture of us framed it . the food was delicious didn t take long . great experience , will definitely come back !
an awesome little italina deli , i would recommend the il purista sandwhich . the prosciuto is so good . this is not a fast place so don t expect your order to come flying out at you but its worth the wait in my opinion . also has a good little selection of olive oils , olives , breads , and other goods available.
my go to meat shop in leslieville . family run , good meats , good prepared foods . i usually pick up their fresh turkey for the holidays , juicy steaks , bacon and their delish cured sausages . i also enjoy their steak sandwich , schnitzel sandwich , . and i just discovered their homemade chili con carne . awesome . 
it would be more stars except for portion size . still delish . had the new brisket meal ( with a coupon of course )  delish !
what a trattoria . very friendly wait staff a warm family atmosphere . the food is exquisite and priced well .
cool intimate place . semi elegant without the elegant cost . haven t had my dish yet . relaxing oriental music playing .
pretty diverse menu , with good vegan and gluten free options . decent service . very laid back vibe it s a good place to spend an hour or two , but don t expect to quickly run in and out with your morning coffee .
our first time here . absolutely loved the rockier road . i had a scoop in a waffle cone it was fantastic . the ice cream is very creamy and delicious . staff is super friendly . we will most definitely be coming back .
we recently leased a rr sport and justin has been our guy . so glad he approached us while we were browsing it was like a sales match made in heaven . i usually cringe at having to be at a dealership but this experience has been completely painless . while putting in our long afternoon test driving and shopping , justin bought us lunch and made us feel at home . our car is amazing exactly what we wanted . they treat customers very well here and throw in fun extras like we got to pick out a few nice key chains and i got my kid a model sport just like mine . highly recommend las vegas land rover and justin cambron !
just back after staying for a week in the venetian las vegas . it is a brilliant hotel with every effort made to make your stay memorable . the place is clean and well maintained . the restaurants around the canal are of a very high standard and reasonably priced . had a suite in the venetia tower and it was perfect .
finally . people who know how to use scissors . got here to fix my hair because the other place in matthews didn t do my hair right . even though there was a language barrier with adelcio and myself , he did my hair right and more . he did more than what i asked . he made sure everything was right . coming back here .
just moved back to cleveland and needed a new place to get my my haircuts . their newer barber dale , gave me a clean fade and makes me feel like a can trust coming here from now on . the environment is awesome because of the genuine hospitality .
zuzu s has gorgeous and unique flowers and the best customer service out there . we have purchased corsages and boutonnieres for prom homecoming at zuzu s and all the girls are always jealous of my son s date .
difficile de faire plus innovant , le mousso offre un bol d air a la gastronomie montrealaise . du talent a l etat brut , le jeune chef antonin nous a surpris avec sa cuisine nouveau monde et des combinaisons de saveurs tres recherchees . le jeune staff dynamique est agreable et pas pretentieux faites leur confiance . reservez avant c est toujours plein .
fried chicken sandwich and onion rings massive portion looks impressive but sadly there was very little taste . but grease .
we come to vegas frequently for trade shows and grotto is always a required stop . never had a bad meal here , but there is one thing that keeps us coming back: their lasagna is spectacular . ask for a table across the hall overlooking the pool and the shark tank for a great dining experience .
i like the atmosphere and the morris ( house )  ramen has good flavor , not overly salty . service was decent . ordered bok choy in the ramen which was not properly cleaned , had some dirt still inside . server apologised and we asked it to be removed from our bill , which they agreed to . also ordered the pork bun which was tasty . kind of like bbq rib meat on a yeast roll . will return but will skip the bok choy next time  ) .
great spot for craft beer or some cocktails . extensive beer list covering several pages and some pretty unique options . the food is ok but not the highlight , you would come for a drink and maybe end up eating versus the other way around . still , they usually have specials , including a weekly buck a shuck oyster deal , so you may find yourself more likely to order dinner than you expected .
this place is way over priced and the hair stylists take when to long to hair peoples hair i love jess and lexi with a burning passion but i no longer can do this anymore i would wait because the price was right now there is no point time to find a new place.
very good service . the owner is very nice and place is new so it s clean . price is great and portion is is just right .
loving all of the new upgrades and design of the store . way to step it up with all the new shops being built . as always super friendly staff . 
they were very friendly at this one . we usually go to the one in hudson , but might switch to this one . they greeted us as soon as we walked in and kept huge smiles on their faces . they actually ran out of brown rice and felt bad about it ( not sure how you don t keep up on the rice )  , and comped us some chips and guac for it . tacos were delicious as always .
delicious authentica love the mole ( wasnt too sweet )  , the tacos and the rice too . i am going back this coming week to try more . i will eat here again an again.
had the pork bone soup with house made kimchi broth was nice and flavourful and sour . pork was very tender . good banchan . funny drinks in lightbulbs .
good donuts , super friendly staff . the maple bar has a nice crispy bottom . location is really convenient if you re in sun city .
i come here with my family every week and have never been disappointed with the food service . best filet mignon in town i highly recommend it above all else on the menu . also the rainbow salad is a great start .
worse food ever . i order a plate which was barely to see the chicken shawrma on top of rice and oily.
what a beautiful arena . there isn t a bad seat in the place , the sound is fantastic and the outdoor area is great too . we saw the ducks play the knights and the knights fans were so enthusiastic about their team and good to us ducks fans .
good ambiance , drinks , go in the early am if avoiding a crowd , otherwise i d check out the happy hour time.
i have never used central towing before but i will again . great job bebo . there at estimated time , quickly addressed getting my car carefully on the towing vehicle . he was pleasant , polite and i enjoyed my drive to the dealership with him . he dropped off the car and disappeared like a knight in shining armor . job well done . you made a frustrating morning less frustrating !
been here twice now for happy hour , and the deals are great . appreciate that there s happy hour every day , and not just a few days a week . great food , nice aesthetic , and good service . cory , the gm , even chatted with us and went above and beyond taking pictures for us . can t recommend this place enough !
not impressed . boring pizza , almost no sauce and had no seasoning . but generous portion for a small order .
i had initially selected this facility because of the high reviews on google . unfortunately , my experience has left a sour taste in my mouth . my physiotherapist made fun of my inability to perform the exercises . excuse me , why would i even come in if i did not have issues in the first place . that showed such a lack of professionalism i cannot believe they are still employed . if you do not want to be laughed at , save your time and pick another office . there is no shortage in toronto .
reasonable price . workmanship subtlety . high efficiency and high service . good service , perfect attitude.
was happy to have a big law firm on my side , but its been just that another big firm , only writes back once . after that idk my emails must get lost . i havent been treated well or never get checked up on . maybe because im not worth as much as the lady undernearth me idk but , i was wrong . still dealing with my case and feel like the doctors and my attorney is burdened by my injury or something .
holy cow , their food is outstanding , but their tortillas are the best in phx , home of the best mexican food in the us . that is saying a lot , i know , but please check them out for yourself . i m going back to phx soon for the first time since moving away , and carolina s will be my first stop . i m salivating just writing this review . truly awesome . 
i cant tell you how much i appreciate the people at blue dog . they had my coach in and out of service before i could even get a drop off date at camping world . mr michael gilsdorf was a pleasure to deal with . he understood our concerns and was able to answer any questions we had . thank you blue dog rv you have definitely earned our business .
hot giardinara pepper is a must . i always stop by defalco for these peppers . they are home made and delicious . the menu at defalco have variety of delicious food and it often took me a while to make a decision on what i should order . it is because i don t want to miss any delicious options offered on that day . my all time favorite is eggplant parmigiana sandwich . the lightly fired eggplant is so tasty and juicy .
great sushi and great service . i m really happy to have found a good sushi place so close to home !
excellent ny style pizza . very good appetizers , especially the mushrooms . every ingredient even the salads use only the very best . the service was also very strong . highly recommended , they do deliver .
i hesitate to give them the five stars they deserve because they have a really small dining area and more customers , selfishly , would complicate things for me . chicken panang is quite good with a superb brown rice . decent wine list . after three visits the wait staff remembered what i like ( complicated )  and always get the order right .
great for happy hour or coffee . either way a great spot in the neighborhood for quality food and drinks . their patio is very private and dog friendly . the inside is kinda small so it s a great place for when the weather is great !
great homemade margaritas . have gone back twice since i first went . gets better each time .
yeay . earl is finally here in az . earl vegas is one of my fav late night grub after gambling . their chicken avocado sandwich is awesome and u have to try it w their steak sauce . dip , grub . repeat . num num love warm sandwiches and love that they have soup too . taste just like vegas one : ) .
has good potential but very bad maintained . the padding is done , needs to be replaced , holes everywhere . so are those huge flowers or what ever those are . ripped . very dirty too . there was a a very dirty towel laying on the floor disgusting . please the city of vegas come and clean it !
i am still scratching my head , wondering why guy fieri liked this place so much . it was clean , the food was good , but so is subway . sorry .
food was amazing . the menu isn t huge , but it is all delicious . started off with a maid in mexico cocktail and sea salt chips w onion dip , and had the scallops for my entree . soooo good . unfortunately i was too full to have dessert . service was as good as the food . they substituted spinach for brussels sprouts in the sweet potato tortelli the only vegetarian dish here and my friend loved it . i will definitely come back .
solid snow ice spot with bubble tea . they have some interesting snow ice combos on the menu to help the first timers out . i couldn t fight the childish urge to get the milk snow ice with fruity pebbles . it didn t disappoint . they have ample seating and a cool roll up door on the front that makes the space an inside outside space with some nice fresh air .
this place was recommended to me by a coworker . i had the jerk chicken potato . yummy . ms dee loves to welcome people into her place and make them the best baked potato ever . , i will be back . , it s good to see small places like this showing up in the neighborhood . i m all about supporting the locals over the chains . ms dee i ll be back.
love the food , the service and serene decor . travel from toronto just to get my fix . definitely worth the trek but wish they were closer . the garlic naan and saag paneer are my must haves but the other dishes did not disappoint . tried the yonge location as it s a little closer to home but unfortunately not the same .
best bagels in montreal . and as a native new yorker , yes i do like these bagels very much . it s a must try .
good wine selection , great cheese plate , charcuterie plate wasn t bad . its as good as you will find in most any airport .
hands down best chinese restaurant . visiting scottsdale and was recommended , did not disappoint . friendly wait staff , wonderful suggestions and the food was amazing . great choice !
nice enough service , but both dishes we ordered lacked flavor . the everybody wang chung was extremely salty . the food was hot , but that was about it .
who doesn t love in and out . animal style is a must . long line but expected , it goes quick anyways so don t let that discourage you .
this is my favorite local pizza spot in cleveland heights . the pizza is terrific and they have so many choices that we can try something new each and every time ( i never do though i m a creature of pizza habit )  . i put the bogo spice in everything , and i even like the miracle crust pizza i don t know if it s healthy but it definitely tastes great .
not even gonna put awhole paragraph , but if you can avoid this plasma center . poor service . i don t even wanna rate one star , my opinion . they need to close this whole facility down .
these guys do a great job . honest , hard working , competent , friendly . i ve taking my car here for a year and will continue to for many more .
great place if you are craving for dim sum . it s not far from las vegas blvd . they have all kind of dim sum like any other chinese restaurant . and they taste good too .
the patio furniture alone is a major improvement . it s so comfortable and inviting . great menu , great service . so far so good . 
the receptionist was horribly rude . i came in to order take out and was treated just horribly . there are many other places i will bring my buisness to from now on and i will not recommend this restaurant to anyone . get some manners young lady !
what a nice little cafe . i always get the biscuit and gravy with eggs and hash browns , which are perfectly crisped . i wish i could put my finger on what makes the gravy so good so i could make it at home , haha . they also have deliciously thick milkshakes . i wish they had more seating but it s good that people keep it full .
good food but had to ask for mushrooms on my chicken vegetable noodles . only came with green and red peppers . no carrots , broccoli , or anything . the hot and sour soup is some of the best i ve had . the noodles were cooked perfect . i would recommend this place out of all the restaurants in the venetian . good value.
got the groupon for the two drinks and they are so yummy . the portion size is huge .
one of my favorite nightclubs in vegas . good dj s , but nothing very exciting ever happens . people just stand there and stare at each other , waiting to have that crazy vegas experience . i do appreciate the willy wonka acid trip decor .
went to firestone after killing my tire . they didn t have my exact tire in stock , so nate had someone pick it up and replace it same day . the customer service i experienced was awesome everyone , especially nate , was great to work with . they seemed pretty swamped for a thursday , but he was always friendly and was great about calling to update me on the status . i highly recommend !
this is a pretty solid mexican option . it is close to the capitol building , so it s pretty centrally located . there is indoor and outdoor seating . the chips and salsa are great , but they are even better if you order queso sauce as well . margaritas were good . i tried the seafood enchiladas , which were very good . my friends liked their food too . i would definitely go back for some good mexican .
tons of food . kind wait staff . off the beaten path of the strip so fewer dumb spring breakers and irritating tourists . great food . i can see why floyd mayweather and penn jillette love this place.
the only good thing in this part of montreal . starting from the smell till the last drop leaves your tastebuds . its a kosher place which means that somebody keeps an eye on the cleanliness too .
yes the hype is worth it . check out the brisket for sure !
i used steven jones at the scottsdale homestore to list and sell my home near cave creek . the team was so good and took care of everything . the house sold and we had to pack up . i would recommend them highly .
great burgers . and an organic beef alternative is available at an extra cost . tasted the same as regular beef , but made me feel better eating it !
great little spot with amazing albeit expensive drinks . if premium cocktails are what you are after , this is the spot . enough unusual and rare spirits to make your head spin . of note they have one of the best smoked meat sandwiches in the city in my opinion . it s very undersold on the menu but features some killer brisket . really tasty . despite being a gin bar they also have a great beer selection of local and western canadian varieties . good service . great decor . on a personal note , they really need to partner with big rig distillery out of nisku , ab . fits the mo .
the people who volunteer here are amazing . these dogs are very lucky to have so many caring people giving their time for free . i will be back when i need a dog or cat .
good mexican food and atmosphere . they make the guacamole table side , which means every batch is different . i ve had a few us ripe chunks of avocado there . i really like the seafood options they have here , the scallops were large and cooked perfectly .
trump you need to get your food game together . you re supposed to be a upscale hotel and the food is beneath that . i had the chicken sandwich and it was honestly disgusting . i like this hotel . but the food is not good .
these guys were clutch , they fixed my flat tire at no cost . super trustworthy guys with fast service . i will be coming here in the future for all tire needs . you guys rock !
love this place . old school diner vibe was great along with the background music . burger and fries were great and prepared exactly the right way . only reason i knocked off a star is that i do know it s possible to get a precooked and then regrilled burger ( out of a warmer next to the grill )  . mine was fresh however and was very very good . had a blt and zucchini fries today . awesome !
the barista kept giving me the wrong cup of latte . the previous people in front of me had ordered the same kind . she kept leading me on saying that it was mine , but didn t bother to read the names on the cup instead . there s a reason why they ask for your name on the cup lady . thank goodness i don t work too far from this location because every order takes a little too long .
finally a decent sushi and korean restaurant in the . neighbourhood . staff is friendly . the aburi sushi rolls are better at miku but everything else is more than acceptable and reasonably priced .
these little guys look awesome , the boy is handsome and clean and the girl is just ropeadoping around in joy . i couldn t make this stuff up but i m impressed . they did an awesome job !
purchased from out of state and had a wonderful experience . david politzer made the transaction seamless . thank you for all of you help . 
extremely knowledgable and always willing to help . customer service and pricing cannot be beat . i recommend to anyone and everyone . competes with online sites and most times beats their best prices . i continue to stock up all my supplements with ds nutrition and have yet to be disappointed .
the wait is worth it . you can go in the lounge to have cocktails to kill the time for your name to be called makes the wait seem better . believe me when i say is worth it .
our go to spot for upscale tex mex . always a great time and consistent quality and service . table side prepared guacamole is a must .
our waitress heather was awesome . this place is great with huge portions . yum . i tried the breakfast quiche pizza and it was really good . the sunrise croissant sand which was delicious , pork carnitas with tomatillo sauce was fantastic !
this is our go to place when we want a good bite to eat . my husband loves to hand pick his ribeye . i am vegetarian , so i always get the salad , which is actually wally good . i live the sweet potatoes . they are huge . the fresh made rolls with cinnamon butter are always my favorite . great bar service and the foh manager always pays a visit to each table to make sure their dining experience is always great .
even the lunch portions are ginormous . they have great chips and flavorful salsa and a wide variety of dishes on their menu . i love the pollo rico special with rice and beans . service is always on par and food makes it out quick and correct the first time !
i was visiting vegas from anchorage , alaska and michael helped me service my watch . i didn t even have to wait . the whole experience was great . i would definitely recommend .
have eaten here three times . wood fired dishes are quite good , especially the chicken steaks not that great . the squash soup was excellent the first time i had it , but tasted inappropriately sweet the next . the cioppino is the best i ve had anywhere . unlike louisianne s , which adds pasta , this is a wonderful , thick tomato based broth with lots of fresh seafood and that s it . i ll be back for the cioppino . kind of noisy . looks like a good singles spot .
alright this place is one of the best ramen places in az that i have tried . coming from san diego i fell in love with ramen and this place makes me feel like i am back in ca . i would definitely come back for more !
surprised to find this gem in an almost empty strip mall . superb food and great ambience . there is something here for everyone . the crying tiger is a great steak . sweet and sour is not overly fruity . coconut icecream is worth having as main course . food is so authentic , the servers may not understand you well . who cares . great food in a classy restaurant .
excellent place . was tattooed by zane who was amazing . knew exactly what i wanted before i did . i gave him an idea and trusted his experience which was the best advice i could give anyone . he fixed up a tattoo which i wanted to be perfect my whole life . amazing guy . amazing artist . amazing shoppe . worth every penny .
the rooms are very large with excellent beds and spacious baths . amenities are high quality . in room coffee is good and convenient . our rate included breakfast , an enhance continental buffet , we greatly enjoyed . the staff was extremely helpful and courteous . my only complaint is that the in room tv was extremely difficult to operate . it had a several second lag in response to button pushes and led you through a set of obscure menus to get to the regular channels .
you definitely have to give praise to the buyer of this store . i believe they could charge the prices they do because of how rare the products are . i personally have a hard time buying used stuff , but this store is a must if you are into thrift store shopping . i will be back just to check out all the vintage purses they find .
right off the interstate , so there are a lot of things right around it . decent room . hotel has a bar and a bunch of nice places in the lobby to lounge .
location: inside the crystals shopping center ambiance: modern with japanese touches very las vegas yum: yellowtail ( crispy jalapeno , garlic dust , tiny cilantro , calimansi soy )  , citrus miso cod lettuce cups , and seared albacore roll bottoms us: saketinis , bottled sake ( sorry forgot the brand )  service: friendly and attentive notes: this place is beautiful and fun and they serve food to match . we asked our waiter what he recommeneded and ordered everything on his list . everything was very flavorful and fresh . yum yum yum . i cannot wait to go back . eat it . love it . repeat .
amazing customer service . i can t speak highly enough about the manager , dennis . i bought a slip cover couch and love seat from this store and a few months later the fabric started pulling . i went into the store to let them know and was pleasantly surprised that they were so accommodating in getting me a new slip cover . i am thrilled with this store and will continue to buy from them in the future .
i had an amazing experience getting my new furniture from ocean furniture . ken is an amazing person that has given us the greatest service , quick delivery and overall , an amazing price on the furniture . i will keep to use them for future purchases . highly recommended .
delicious salted caramels . read about them in the ny times . : ) .
the tacos are delicious ( period )  . tried three , each with a great distinct flavor profile . the food actually looks like the pictures . staff was very nice . let me try a few of their hot sauces .
i have not been to the opera house for a few years but my recent experience there will definitely encourage future trips . it is funky place with loads of atmosphere and a good sound system . the staff and security are excellent , in fact i had asked a manager there a question and even got a reply on gig day which is awesome athena . if you havent been to the opera house you owe it to yourself to check this gem of a place out .
great , big , filling burritos . had a steak burrito . delicious . it had an almost crispy shell which i loved . also had their supreme fries . great as well !
great little coffee place . super friendly staff , delicious empanadas and , if you go , the tres aztecas is absolutely divine !
typical great venetian palazzo restaurant . drinks were amazing . bartender professional and friendly . food was just as expected . loved the chicken . it was some of the best i ve had . was too full for the sides . manager was very helpful . place has a great vibe . good alternative to fancy places .
this is a stand up company . i did not request overnight shipping when i ordered , but then our dog ( who has cancer )  took a turn for the worse . i called back the next morning and explained the situation . not only did she track down my order and overnight it , i opened it and found a toy for our pup . thank you for your awesome customer service .
this is a pretty good store as far as guitar centers go . the selection is average , not much in the pro audio and lacking in the guitar pedals section . the service was great however . i got a great deal on the keyboard stand i was purchasing there . easy location to reach , lot s of parking .
coffee is great , hits the spot for the cali girl in montreal winter here . sweet they have an indoor bike rack for winter .
the subs are good , just a little expensive ( for sandwiches )  . if you want a step above subway this is a good place to go .
bath and body works is always lovely to walk into , the smells and the colors are so inviting . but today i want to leave this review for diana . she was absolutely wonderful positive , cherry , and so helpful . i ended up walking out w multiple products she suggested . she deserves a raise . thank you for making me smile today .
i ve never done an escape room before , and this one was awesome . did king of the bootleggers with my friend and we had a blast . casa loma is awesome !
unimpressed . i haven t been here in years and i wanted something better than taco bell but didn t want chipotle . well i should have chose of of those . everything i ordered was bland including the salsa and guacamole . and my churro was cooked twice so it tastes like grease instead of cinnamon and sugar .
great shop . honors appointment times , does quick work at a reasonable price and has knowledgeable techs . recommended without reservation to anyone needing work .
worst internet and tv provider ever . bunch of liars . i agree that the poor employees and technical support were nice and kind and very helpful but they can t do anything about the so called signal which is by the way keep on freezes our prism tv and even internet . even the remote control and dvr doesn t work quick . liars liars this company is a fraud.
those totchos tho . it has fun free games and reasonable priced food and drinks . what more could you ask for ?.
so just got done eating . i had the broccoli beef and it was very good . the fried rice on the other hand was not cooked all the way . my wife had the shrimp lo mein and she enjoyed it . the restaurant is very clean .
this place is always a good lunch place . soup with no msg and good tasting . nicely cooked noodle and quick on getting food out . they offer alot of variety in the noodle since you get to pick and choose .
the christmas light display was recommended . lights were extremely disappointing , but the live nativity scene should appeal to the christian visitors . very large gift shop . did not visit the museum so i can not comment on that part of the site .
awesome deals , can t go wrong with service and honesty . i recommend for any services , questions , and hard to find just plain old help . i ll be back .
i ll spare the details but i had a rather unusual problem with an expensive item i purchased at this location . i called and expected to be stuck at the store for a while but the manager had taken care of the issue ( and then some )  before i even made it to the store . impressed !
i am a faithful patron of bg and can say it gets better and better each and every single time i have gone . but if you go you must ask for server , carmie . she is the best server i have had in my entire life . what a great experience !
extensive menu and good food were spoiled for me by the unpleasant atmosphere . the host was surly and the waitress was incompetent and impersonal . the staff overall seemed uncaring . we were there mid afternoon on saturday and the restaurant was by no means overly busy . i might go back for take out .
place is awesome . great ambiance , amazing food and hot girls . service is friendly but needs a bit of refinement . order the eggplants entree , wow . sad they took off the gluten free menu .
i have been there a few times . always expecting it to be more fun than it really is . basically a lighted driving range where you can only have one ball at a time . overall not really impressed but will probably go back because that seems inevitable .
i was in last sunday night for football . i sat and ate with with hillary then moved over to the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender lindsey . i told her i was a beer lover and she went over all the craft beers which is not usually common for local bartenders to know their beers . both bartenders were very attentive , always made sure my drinks were full and they were tons of fun and seemed to love their job . highly recommended . good food , drinks and great service.
this review is for the car wash: wow . they did a wonderful job , i had spilled something on my passenger s seat and asked if they would be able to get it clean as well even though that s not part of the interior exterior wash and they did . they could have pushed a detail package on me which i wouldn t have purchased but instead they went above and beyond and because of that i will definitely be back .
matt s lives up to its expectations . simple menu , great tasting food . definitely busy , with fast , super friendly service . i don t know what else you can ask for . their thick cut bacon is so tasty and filling i could not finish it . that says a lot lol . stop by after your morning stroll , bike , or hike , you won t regret it . btw , their lemonade is made with honey and it s soooooo good .
these guys are amazing . i honestly did not think that the pet stains in our carpet could be removed . and carpet monkeys made our carpets practically look new . they were easy to work with on scheduling and were so flexible . mark was awesome . i felt totally comfortable with him working in our house . he explained the process and worked so quickly . i highly recommend carpet monkeys .
we board our dog here every time we leave town . great staff and reasonable rates . highly recommend .
this place is clean , quick , cheap and delicious . i get the jalapeno curry every time . a really delicious take on classic green curry !
simply amazing . the food is outstanding . love this place and the service was excellent !
i loved the look of surrender , with the nice pools , lighting , and open feel of being outdoors , i thought it was a good blend of everything . the music got better as the night progressed . it wasn t too hectic or too crowded , but at the same time still happening . i also liked there were places available to sit . my feet needed a rest at times !
exactly as promised . came from uptown marriott just of the reviews . great hot dogs and cold craft beer and pop . be warned that the red relish on the dogs is spicy . sat on the upper deck and enjoyed watching the last of a great day on charlotte fade into night . onion rings outstanding . p s . checked in on yelp and got a free fries . made an awesome visit even better !
love their tiramisu almont croissants coffee . one of the few cafes that is open untill midnight . v love taking coffee n a pastry n walk in the park . we r a big abt coffee dates n this one of r hot fav places .
i really enjoyed this place , i had great coming any of friends an we all enjoyed those very savory foods , eating with our hands . the bread was amazing so light and fluffy . i was really impressed , the beef was done to perfection and i am not a beef eater . the lentils were fabulous , coming again.
i love dr fulton and his staff . from the moment you walk into the beautiful office , everyone is so warm and welcoming . dr fulton is very thorough with his consultation , making you feel totally comfortable . i have only had botox ( with excellent results )  but i am really looking forward to my facial scheduled for next week . i fully trust dr fulton and his staff for all my beauty enhancement procedures . so glad i found them !
daniel does an amazing job with repair and they have replaced carpet for me in the past as well . overall , they do a wonderful job and i will continue to use them when my doggies decide to chew up my carpet .
lots lots of shops restaurants + a movie theatre . the parking situation is horrible though . however , when you do luck up on a spot , you re able to walk the entire area without feeling super winded . there are lots of options from super high end to budget friendly . popular spot for families , but also for teenagers which may or may not be super annoying .
they are non existent or inaction regarding parking rules in bella monte community . many cars or commercial truck have been parking overnight and during daytime in the streets and obviously , nobody from colonial goes around and check parking especially at nighttime anymore !
not a daring sushi eater . i only eat cooked stuff but this place has some really good cooked rolls . according to my person , they have really good tuna selections .
my favorite hotel and casino in las vegas . i ve been coming to this casino since it first opened and i always have a pleasant experience . their poker room is top notch . nice tables , chairs , leg room and they even have outlets to charge your phone at tables . there s usually no wait or they ll open up a new game quickly . lots of games to choose from also . their hotel rooms are nice and luxurious . your money us well spent if you decide to stay here . i have nothing but good things to say about the venetian . i highly recommend this place .
these are very very good burgers . this place is always busy but your food never takes too long to come out . love the fact that i can get a sunny side up egg on the burgers here !
extra star is for decor . mediocore taste in chicken . ok tasting fries , overpriced overall due to location . no soap in restroom , also not spotless clean . average tasting soda.
nothing quite matches the quality of people that frequent the man cave . the cigars are great too . if you come in to buy a cigar or two , make sure you stick around to smoke one in the lounge and meet some great new friends .
i love their pan seared halibut and pearfection martini .
be careful you don t get your car too dirty before taking it here for a detailing . the wife tried to go today and they refused her after making an appointment . the guy said the moisture from detailing the car could damage the electronics of her saturn ( it s not a new car )  . when i asked if he had another technique , he asked if i knew how to clean things without moisture . i asked him how he cleans his butt . it was downhill from there . needless to say , nothing has been cleaned .
everything is over the top in the best way . blood mary s are incredible and you ve got to get the trashcan nachos . the presentation alone is worth it !
the broth need more flavor . i have taste better . the meet need to be more tender . when you have to add to much sauce is because something is missing on the pho . the spring rolls are too dry . othet than that is a nice looking placr . goof atmosphere .
amazing service by terra . food was on point from the bread to the entree . filet was cooked to perfection and the loaded mashed potatoes are to die for . will definitely be going here more often . thank you for a wonderful experience !
the place was weirdly decorated , food was just ok , family trying to make it . might be back . alcohol was slightly expensive .
this is one of the best seafood sushi dinners i have ever enjoyed . i have eaten in numerous sushi bars and restaurants including chef marimotos in ny and this was amazing fresh and unique . from the fluke in a spicy ponzu sauce cooked with hot oil poured over it to the incredible clam and mushroom soup to the mixed nigiri it kept my taste buds in a state of bliss . the price is steep but worth every penny .
great place to eat vegetarian food but i wish it were a little more special and unique . i like the interesting menu , but the food isn t high quality . i ve had undercooked veggies and bland , wilting bok choy . i keep wanting to give fern another try , but i always don t have high expectations for this place .
great food and beer are a great combo . best chicken dish i have ever had is their parm crusted chicken . caesar salad is always fresh and huge portion pair it with a piranha ale . we go atleast once a month !
waited forever for drinks . then hostess brought a huge coloring book for my kids and box of crayons . crayons had hair in it and coloring book was all colored . she also told me there was no kids menu . waiter gave my salad to wrong person at our table . he took forever to bring wine . he never brought etta sauce asked for . food tasted horrible and like it was frozen and warmed up . bread was so salty you couldn t even handle the . taste . would never go back .
when its hamburger and fries time , its off to the pit stop we go . we are working our way through the menu and everything has been prepared well and we have yet to be disappointed . the staff is mostly local high school college aged girls and they always treat us like we were their parents . great service , great food . our kind of place .
best sushi in vegas . let your waiter choose your sushi . they know whats best and the secret rolls . everything tasted fresh and delicious .
they had the best sushi in the valley and impeccable service . very clean . the owner is really sweet and after complimenting his business he hugged us and said i love you.
very good burger , i tried the richmond hill and church street location , both excellent but richmond hill might have the edge . beef is very fresh and juicy . i would have liked crispier fries but overall the ingredients are high quality and fairly priced .
i think this is the amir off of cresent st . we hit it up after bar hoping , and were all suprised with the food . we got the farlafa s ( chicken , lamb , and chick pea )  , they were all delicious and super cheap . great eats for close to nothing .
as always , black blue burger is excellent . patio full of dogs . lots of fun . great staff , very attentive .
i ve found my new stylist here at salon zen . after auditioning several stylists over the past year ( my previous stylist retired from hair )  i tried salon zen after buying a groupon . sierra was amazing . she really listened and understood what i wanted , suggesting that we add some lowlights to my highlighted blonde hair . suffice it to say , my hair looks absolutely fabulous . i love it . sierra is personable , friendly , and has a great sense of humor . i highly recommend her . i will be back already made my next appointment . thank you , sierra .
i ve been here once and have nothing bad to say . the lou holtz sandwhich was a winner and i look forward to trying other things offered on the menu or making my own creation . the dessert selection was also great , enjoyed eating outside in the little alley .
this place is a great spot in chandler ocotillo area . better to go on thursday , friday or saturday night when the music is way better and there is a dj . during the week pretty quite and the music they play will put you to sleep . however , the baretender ladies are so sweet and can pretty much make you anything you want based on what you feel like drinking . overall a super chill place !
took my girls to enjoy a friday afternoon here . they do have happy hour deals . fyi . atmosphere is open and friendly with seating options inside and outside . fun environment for date night and family night . staff are super friendly and very efficient . we ordered our favorites: baba ganoosh , dolmades , and falafel . the dolmades are the freshest you ll ever have . so yummy . all dishes are decent portions that can be used for family sharing . love this place !
for a family trip to pittsburgh we chose to stay here based on some positive reviews we had read . it did not disappointment . hotel seemed to be relatively new , was very clean and comfortable . staff was friendly and helpful . this location looks to be a part of a growing area with shops , restaurants and office space being built . breakfast was included . close to kennywood , downtown pittsburgh and zoo . great two night stay !
wonderful experience from the moment i called to make the appointment and spoke to nicky , to the warm reception from the owner carolyn , to my amazing therapist wendy . she knew exactly where my troubled areas were and targeted those areas . very thorough , very therapeutic and i could not have asked for a better experience . i will definitely be returning !
meat your destiny at little miss bbq . upon the horizon of hog meat you see a gentle stream of bbq sauce . tides of turkey legs wash ashore . you stop once but you can eat even more . pickled onion zest combines with tasty swine flesh . tangy mustard sauce entangled in beef brisket that is hella boss . you must wait for your meat by weight . but trust me it s worth the wait .
came in to pick up my prescriptions and a flu shot . customer service is hit and miss but i always find what i need here . for me , this is the closest cvs location from my house .
arhaus has very expensive , high end , quality furniture . this store is a great place to go for decorating ideas and to purchase accessories . their style sorta follows that european trend of mixing and matching wood , painted wood and iron for an eclectic , fresh look . they also carry some import items . sometimes , if you get lucky , you can get a great price on floor models . also , get on their mailing list , so you will be notified of sales .
awesome location . great sale aisle though it is not an outlet . great staff very helpful . not like the outlet location but , this one is much better . recommend this location.
this was my first rodeo a d i was very excited about it . i loved the game and all the event was perfect , cowboys and cowgirls were awesome . i am planing to do it again.
it s really a shame that businesses on this street close all the time , they are so far detached from the hustle and bustle that it could be doing further down pen ave near more hotels . the sandwiches here are top notch , and it s the only place i know of to get those delicious bacon maple donuts . everything here is in housed . if only there were better parking !
body worlds . definitely worth seeing if you have the chance . the way they have preserved and displayed these bodies is pretty much dumbfounding . if you haven t attended med school , you ll learn something about your body without being grossed out . i went at noon on a saturday and it was a bit crowded , though not really a bit deal . some exhibits i didn t have the opportunity to scrutinize as much as i would have liked . most were fine though . my favorite part: seeing the suspended artery networks !
fan expo is an experience unlike any other . truely it is life changing . well worth the cost of attending.
their bbq and filipino food is delicious . i noticed this family restaurant with my family when we came to watch movies at the theater next to it . the staff is friendly . try their lumpia and milkfish with garlic rice . it s my favorite .
i brought in my son husband after always being pretty curious about this place just down the street from my residence and i m glad i did . i was so amazed at how more than reasonable the prices are to the large portions . my husband and son both enjoyed their bacon cheeseburgers and they had a very tasty chips and fish with tarter sauce for me . i didn t catch my waitress name , but she was pleasant and friendly as opposed to the negative reviews here . i really appreciated her service and the enjoyable sit down meal we had . thank you !
delicious , and really good combo deals for authentic empanadas . i would also recommend drinking a bottle of fizzy mate with ice .
thanks again rhonda . great . service . really u r profession , detailed and fun . c u in a month . hubby n grandson too . sooo glad that salon has some one like u . finally .
crap service , they know its packed so they don t even try , i d give it a zero star if i could .
first subway i ve ever been to that doesn t offer salads . every other one i ve been to you can order their sandwiches into a salad . lady behind counter was very rude and said just pick a bread hardly could understand her . eat fit huh subway . well not offering an alternative to bread is not eating fit !
great stuffed pizza , feels like you are in chicago . excellent jukebox with alternative tunes , neil young , bob marley , r . e . m . and many others .
i have been a client of vishna s for some time but today i took my grown daughter for a treat . the new shop is beautiful much more spacious with plenty of on street parking . lenaya did great highlights using a natural product and sanya did a simple but effective cut . the results are great . although busy , they work hard to accommodate clients and as a bonus are usually open on sunday .
i saw chocolate so i found myself here on my way to another place . got the dark chocolate with a praline centre and hazelnut on top because it was the lady s favourite . pretty mediocre . i wasn t impressed but based on the amount of christmas orders she had to fill stock pouring out all over the floor i m sure others would disagree with me . she seems pretty popular . the chocolate i tried didn t do it for me but perhaps another one might . definitely worth a try .
love this place . you feel like a million bucks when you leave . beautiful atmosphere with young people working it . go to kelly for a brazilian . she is the best waxer they have . she doesn t make you feel uncomfy at all . will always go back .
i am a big fan of this place . my only complaint is that i occasionally get charged for the wrong drink and the to go coffee bar isn t really geared for a quick in and out service but the bartenders are always good for some banter while you wait . omg did i mention morning happy hour . 
amazing . gifted hands and comforting . everytime i m town , it s a must go . short wait . friendly . great customer service . the best experience at a spa .
some locals took us here for some late night early nachos and it was fantastic . large portions and bean dips was the topping on the cake .
needed to get a replacement alarm fob setup and found streetfighter while doing a web search . very glad i did . the staff were extremely helpful and nice . the job only took a few minutes so they did it at no charge . very hard to find quality customer support and integrity in business these days , but they have have it down pat .
i wish this place had a drive through but service is always quick and pleasant so i don t mind going in . the outdoor area is so charming . they never get the drinks wrong . i can t say enough good things about the service in particular there is one dark haired woman that is so sweet , she makes me smile every time i go in .
the outside look great , the inside made me look twice to check if i was in the right place . i did like the fact they serve egg whites . the prices are a little to much for me when it came to serving size . i had the bacon and avocado egg white omelet , it was delicious .
so much better then in out . the burgers are probably my favorite as far as fast food is considered . i really love the fry sauce as well . my kids love the custard but neilson s is still my favorite for that but they have a close second . next time you want a quick good burger go here.
been enjoying the bbq here for a long time . still a favorite and had lunch here twice in the last week !
update i m giving back the one star i took away for the slow service . it really seems that they re trying to improve this aspect . it was very busy this past friday night full house and the service was fantastic . well done !
place is always smelling good , always organized and reasonable prices for what the items quality and looks are . would definitely come here for redecorating a house or a room . customer service is fast and all of the employees know what they re talking about whenever you ask them something .
the line here is nothing compared to the one in la so this is a plus . the hours are a bit wierd at some times so should always double check before going . the sandwiches are not that bad but its all bout the sluts which is a good appetizer to hold your hunger in if u were planning to eat somewhere filling later .
horrible customer service . the property that we rented of theirs was never even inspected by them before renting , and it was a mess . every time we try to get a hold of someone in accounting , it takes several phone calls to even get through , and the people are rude . horrible company to deal with .
very bad wor wonton soup no wonton skin just starchy dough pockets with very little meat stay away from this soup no shrimps nor slices of pork . i went to another chinese restaurant about four miles from them and got a good ole fashion wor wonton soup the way i ve had it for years .
just your typical best buy just like all the rest . good selection of electronics and can usually find an associate to help you but sometimes not . i do like the fact that they price match these days . i also read they are not going to be carrying audio cds anymore . the true digital age is upon us so if you like cds he can probably pick them up pretty cheap while they re closing them out .
i recently tried the memphis hot wings , it s a dry rub and it was so good . it was flavorful and had a good kick .
gave us the wrong order and charged us for it at the end . we ordered a small party tray but received a medium.
i was so happy to see them at the city north farmer s market . i bought the bbq pork single pies and the steak fajita . i had a taste of the apple one . yum . these are awesome options when the hubby is out of town or if you have people show up suddenly . quick salad and a little pie , ta da . lunch . as a matter of fact , i am going to cook a few for a brunch am throwing next week . they are so flaky and buttery delicious . can t wait to try other flavors .
this isn t the closest hardware store to my home but i often drive the extra distance because i like the staff , who are both knowledgeable and helpful , and because their store is bright and clean .
when you re in the mood to sit in a room of pink , think dazzling cafe . we ordered the rosa latte , which came with rose petals . the drinks and desserts were super sweet , so come prepared to leave with a sugar headache worth it . i m not sure . but the bunny chairs were nice.
food is great but i d visit more often if my order wasn t wrong every single time . our office s favorite is the chicken tortilla salad . it s fantastic !
it was pretty fast but not very personable . one of the employees was on her phone the whole time gossiping .
i have been staying at mgm grand since sunday and i have to say if you are in vegas and want to ensure you get a quality meal for the price then come here . i have had quite a few items on the menu after experiencing terrible food elsewhere and everything was perfect . dashi soup awesome . chicken noodle . incredible . i ate the chinois salad twice it was so goo . burger . yummy . and an incredible seasonal fish dish and creme brulee . best part . amazing service all around !
this is an awesome ramen bar . its small but i think it adds more of homey feel . the food is fresh and it s brought to you fast . great flavor and awesome personalization for your orders . the staff is attentive and will help you if your unsure of how to eat something . good food and a good staff goes well with a cold beer after a long week .
the food was excellent , well presented , served hot and extremely tasty . the restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly and most accommodating . highly recommended . came here based on ratings and was not in the least bit disappointed .
what a wonderful experience we had . jonathan the game guru was great . he was friendly , thorough and actually sat down and played our first round of games with us . games he had suggested based on our group . awesome we were also very happy to see gender neutral bathrooms . also . the nutella latte . perfect.
had take out for lunch and was pleased with my order . the sesame chicken was crunch and good . the location is a bonus .
horrible experience in toronto . kitchen was backed up so everything was way delayed , once food arrived , they messed up my order , and on top of it a nothing was take off the bill despite all the delays and mistakes made during the meal . you expect more from a premier steakhouse , not worse service than any fastfood chain . too bad hy s is a great brand but it seems the toronto location is losing any sense of quality.
i i found that ultimate autos save me from being taken by another auto repair company . when i turn my car over to them and they gave me a quote one quarter of what the other guy quoted me , they did an excellent job and guarantee the job . this was unbelievable . they save me from being scammed by another dealership .
this was an amazing dining experience . very intimate and romantic . a great date place . the shrimp scampi was a rich and flavorful dish . definitly come here for a special occasion .
had my hair done by joseph v . amazing . i did a red ombre with cut and hit it on the spot . he styled it for a couple minutes in the end it turned out sooo beautifully . i had so many compliments already . best part , during the whole process , he took his time which i appreciate even though he had another client waiting . ( which the other client didnt even mind waiting because thats how good he is )  thanks !
amazing . the atmosphere is quaint , everyone is so friendly , and the food is incredible ( and affordable )  . i ve tried several things on their menu and they re always delicious though i m partial to the spring rolls . they also do delivery , which is pretty quick . highly recommended !
very friendly staff . miss the complimentary shuttle to the other hard rock cafe . the music was not loud .
wonderful and helpful employees . i really enjoy shopping at this location . great selection and priced . only issue is a lot of rotation . but they re helpful in finding items att other stores if you really need them .
this is a great sports bar for drinks and food . i highly recommend it !
worst service i ve ever had here tonight . and the sad part is that i love happy dog . it s usually a fun , relaxing atmosphere . the server was rude ( maybe he just didn t like women )  , didn t want to take our questions ( walked away while answering )  , and wasn t attentive enough to even ask if we wanted refills of drinks .
great menu selection . food is unique , in a good way . the beer battered chicken strips were amazing and the sauce was very good . it is darker lit , but very clean . pleasant atmosphere and staff , good portions and reasonable prices .
the crew here is tight and great . all of the barbers do their best . sometimes the wait is long but you just come back later . i ve been coming here for quite sometime and can tell you leave your wife or girl outside lol . they get too offended too quickly .
bz has a great happy hour and a good selection of draft beer . i typically stick to drinks and appetizers and i have never had a problem . i would avoid bz when the pirates are in town unless you like long waits for food and drink .
dinner was overpriced and not well prepared . my filet mignon was overcooked and took forever to get replaced , the smashed potatoes were very salty . not recommended for d.
just visited today . was a very good experience . walked through several cars and saw passenger cars , sleeper cars , dining cars , cargo cars . rang the bell in the steam engine . had a nice time looking at the variety of old train cars . will be back .
fantastic place to dine while stoned . the environment is totally trippy . made me feel like i was in cloud atlas at the restaurant getting fed people . a+ experience . plus the house music makes you trip even harder and every one around you will notice . probably a biased opinion because i ve onlu been here under the influence .
weak and sometimes pretty bad service when it isn t even busy . only come here because my friends order all the expensive stuff . employee told me to write the table number on my order too .
great service and atmosphere and even better food . my husband s go to is the raspberry stuffed french toast but we ve had many items from the menu and everything fabulous . there is almost always a wait on the weekend , but it goes by quick !
come here for lunch when i m working because of the awesome salad bar . as i went more i was astonished at the amount of healthy alternatives they have from deserts to just about anything u could think of . fine selection of supplements and teas . nice people and always find what i m looking for.
from the moment you walk in you have a warm welcome and the best pizza ever . i am hooked not going anywhere else tomatoes so sweet got to try .
burntwood tavern is one of my favorite places , so i was really excited when i received word that they were building one in fairlawn . i have tried many things on their menu , all have been delicious . i am vegetarian so i might be a little biased here , but the veggie wrap is my favorite menu item . i know it s good because even my non vegetarian friends love it as well . i also always get the hummus for an appetizer.
i brought these pillows online after hearing about this product and find it doesn t perform to level that is reflected in the tv commercials . i can t recommend this product .
while they could have more low carb options and be a little less pricey , the food is definitely excellent for its price . i would highly recommend the spanish omelette . it s probably one of the best omelettes i ve had in a long time !
great cut . jacob is a fascinating guy . he gave me a fade , used a straight razor . it was a quality job .
the steak and salmon were delicious , however , we decided to try granny s apple classic dessert . the apple pie was fine as was the vanilla ice cream . the sweet topping poured over the top was gelatinous and just covered the entire dessert . might be a good idea to put that on the side .
took my wife there on a weekend getaway , and we were very happy with the taste and quality of food for the price . in ny the price would have been twice the price . highly recommend .
fabulous . i love having these guys make my windows sparkle . they are always on time , clean and professional . prices are very good , as well .
second time stopping in here while traveling to the area for work . ambiance is amazing , colorful , and as a chicagoan i love eating dinner outdoors in december : )  food wise you can t go wrong . the street corn queso is a must , the tacos are all excellent , the trail mix salad is also really really tasty . oh and the drinks and sangria are not to be missed !
not good . enchilada meat , chicken and steak , were dry . sauce sucked . the house margaritas , though fresh , were too tart . the guac was bland . how hard is it to taste the food for seasonings when you make it . pretty hard to screw up guac but they did it . sorry , wish i could say better this .
went here for lgtchocolatchaud , i love the cocoa coated marshmallow . tried a bar also but wasn t impressed :( .
great food , drinks and service . we were seated immediately without a reservation on a friday evening . among three of us we ordered four small plates and two rice dishes , and it was more than enough food . highlights were the eggplant , pork katsu , grilled squid , and potato salad .
dr . patel and his staff are very friendly and thorough . they took time to explain any issues that i had and options that were available . i would highly recommend patel dental care !
really awesome crepes with good prices . the location is very convenient as it is on rue st catherine and close to all of the major shopping centers . service was very friendly and quick . i was able to utilize the free wifi too . yummmm !
im a decent barista , but these guys are amazing . totally progressive in their approach . ill admit i was apprehensive at first . most impressive was the complexity of their single origin . no need for a blend . i tried the el salvador ( cap ) and burundi ( macchiatto )  the default coconut or almond milk is a plus , but most baristas cant pull that off and make it taste right . it tasted right . these guys are official .
avoid the white backdrop as their awful prints will make you look washed out . one of the photographers called my one year old daughter a drama queen because she was crying . agree with the previous comment about the employees interrupting each other . better yet , just avoid like the plague .
love this spot . always have loved the idea of revolving sushi . it always tastes fresh , and it s so great to walk in , sit down , and have your food ready . staff was extremely nice and we didn t have to wait at all to be seated . food is delicious and great pricing .
awesome service . our technician robert was prompt , courteous and above all honest . will definitely use this company for all of our heating and air conditioning needs .
this place has the slowest service ever . food is ok if you don t mind waiting forever for it to come .
anita s is always tasty and one of favorite places for lunch . i ve tried the quesadillas , tacos , and burritos . they always give chips and salsa with every order . service is always on point . two thumbs up !
i took my friends from out of town here for the first time and we were very pleasantly surprised . the fajitas were amazing . the chicken tacos were awesome . great service . i highly recommend making a reservation . yes the place is busy even during the week . enjoy .
the service was decent . the sangria was delicious . i love that they have various types of seatings such as couches , booths , etc . the nachos were okay . could have done with more toppings . they were a bit sparsely put on .
amazing sushi and interesting cocktails . staff was friendly and prompt , atmosphere very fun . order the tuna tataki . some of the best sushi i ve ever had . will definitely be returning next time i m in vegas .
the place is clean and organized . jessica took her time cutting my hair and did an outstanding job .
christine s fit me in last minute for a cut and color . it s a small salon with a lot of personality . christine and dana were very friendly and dana did a great job on my hair . i ll definitely be going back .
best wings around . they are fried longer then most places so they are crispier on the outside , so that might be a turnoff to some . the place is a dive , but the people there are friendly .
absolutely obsessed with this place . friendly staff , fun atmosphere , beautiful patio , delicious food and drinks . i recommend it for brunch , dinner , and drinks !
spent the weekend in las vegas at the palazzo and enjoyed an amazing brunch meal at the yardbird with my bridal party . we were immediately seated and greeted by a server named christina , who took wonderful care of us throughout the entire meal . the char broiled churrasco hit the spot . i could eat that every day , it was so delicious . we had a great time at yardbird and shared many laughs with our extremely kind and positive server . it was the perfect brunch to cap the bachelorette weekend !
the food in this place wayyyyyyy exceeded my expectation . i was blown away by how flavourful the tofu stew is . and the price is very decent . it s amazing how you walked into a random restaurant and food in here made your day . will definitely come back .
this may be the only place in scottsdale i would take out of scottsdale and relocate to somewhere close . it is that good , even with the chain shops and restaurants .
great staff , have not moved in yet but can t wait . chloe was very helpful with showing me my new place and all the info i needed for applying !
disgusting . i feel like this place belongs on a dirty dining report somewhere . no covers over the plates on the conveyor belt . thick build up of dust on the ventilation system right over where food is being prepared busser cart full of dirty dishes being pushed around in the main dining areas long , long lines with tables seat going unbussed for prolonged periods of time rude and disorganized staff do yourself the favor , keep driving and go down to sushi eye or sakana .
this location is the worst one i ve been too . their customer service is handle poorly rudely . non efficient . i prefer the one on bell rd which is a bit of a drive but i d rather take that drive than to deal with few of the workers here . mind it s not all but i refuse to pay my good earned working money on rude service .
great place . took a gamble and we were very happy with the results . low key , game was on and the food was fresh and perfect . we will certainly be back .
i highly recommend structura . i had a massage last week , it was amazing . i had been having pain in a number of areas and i am now virtually pain free . thank you.
food was okay but not the quality i expected from a celebrity chef s restaurant charging the prices they do . the worst part of the evening was our waiter who seemed to entertain himself by making extremely inappropriate comments to my wife and i during the entire course of our meal .
this place ha been packed each time we went . that being said the service was good . our breakfast was timely and delicious .
welcome home . once you step foot into this church , you are immediately captivated and embraced in the most welcoming arms . the messages directly reflect jesus words and messages . and the worship . the worship is absolutely incredible . wow . i love hillsong glendale .
cashier decided to basically wave around my personal products ( condoms , etc )  , then basically after showing everyone behind in a big line what i was getting , she decided to rudely question my girlfriends age like i m some creep , as were leaving making a scene , and embarrassing me , and my girlfriend . i would go elsewhere if you need buy something discretely .
i was late and they still seen me and very patient and i loved my visit plus i got what i want . it s a girl i m sooooo excited the doctor was greaaaaaat i recommend everyone here.
always a great visit to see dr . rouhani . always looks out for the best interest of his patients , and that s why his practice is growing . if you are looking for a new dentist , definitely consider smile concepts .
the food is trendy and the drinks are cold and strong . great location , great staff . i have been there three times and have always eaten on the patio there is usually an art show or something going on , and you can put your name in and they will text you when your table is ready . i plan to go again soon !
great show , amazing entertainer , and incredible showman . the randomness in which everything happened and he was still able to get it right was insane . amazing job !
run do not walk . this community may look nice on the outside and the remodeled apartments are done nicely but the plumbing is the worst . be prepared to go without water sometimes days at a time . the water shut offs due to plumbing or boiler problems is a regular occurrence . also , the construction is old so you literally live with your neighbors . you will hear their foot steps , shower , toilet , conversations , television and every other kind of noise a person may make . if i could give them half a star , i would . for the money , you can find a better place .
think of chipotle ordering for enchilada and tacos . but that is where the comparison ends . my wife and tried this place yesterday for the first time . we were very surprised the level of quality food , better than many higher end mexican restaurants .
this place has it all: inventive combinations , ability to customize your meal , fresh from the farm vegetables and tasty vegan options . the lines of satisfied customers are proof that this place is a winner !
what an awesome crew we had move us . aaron and his crew were wonderful . i can t thank them enough . they were so polite and took such care with our furniture . also dan lyman ( estimator )  was spot on with his estimate on the total cost for the move . also i wanted to thank sherry for making sure everything run smoothly from start to finish . i really appreciated her calling when the guys were here just to make sure everything was going as planned . we will highly recommend your company for moving a+ thanks again to all . job well done . bill and shari.
meh , gas station with a small casino and a store . surprisingly the odds on video poker were pretty good . definitely designed for truckers and likely pretty good for that .
beautiful right on lake the salmon was great crab cake burgers awesome bea and heather gave super service try the portuguese tarts for dessert in all decent prices and amazing service and food.
excellent chinese food at a decent price . we always have good food here . hubby and father in law had the general tso s chicken , i had the chicken teriyaki . all cooked to order and no issues . will definitely be back !
jade red chicken is great . orange chicken quesadilla is great as well . that s right . asian + mexican cuisine ( i use that loosely )  all in one . grease for days .
have eaten there twice . our first experience , slow afternoon , was pretty good . ok food , industrial decor , good location . second time was on a saturday night: neglectful to outright rude service . meal: ho hum . overall , disappointing .
fresh , and authentic mexican food . friendly staff too . if you like tacos you must try this place . everything is prepared in front of you while you wait . the other mexican food joints can t compete with taco y taco .
myself and my party had an excellent experience eating while served by angela . we thoroughly recommend coming here . thank you for going above and beyond while serving us !
i loved the food and the service . very cute place with clean bathrooms . disappointed by the desserts but the food was so good i didn t mind . next time i go i will buy more appetizers , salads and entrees to try and not buy desserts .
amazing . pawel is by far the best employee i have ever met at any establishment . very caring and attentive . definitely coming back !
my new favorite spot . the meat pies are delicious . the croissant cinnamon rolls absolute heaven . there s nothing better in this world than the chicken pot pie . the staff and owner are super friendly . just an all around great place to grab a bite . we ve been every day since we found the place . saturday and sunday they are closed but are at the farmers market . meat pies for life !
awesome place to get healthy breakfast , lunch and dinner . love the purple rain smoothie , its just delish . love the salad as well , especially the champagne pomegranate dressing.
great vegetarian restaurant . fun hip environment . had kombucha , hummus appetizer , and squash filet dinner . it was out of this world . great service too . had to provide a credit card to make a reservation . will be back soon . 
it says right on their website all these different things that they perform in office but when i asked them they say they don t do that here i just wanted to get a simple cortisone shot know you have to go to a specialist.
my experience with this company was wonderful . we went in to see about laptops and came out with a great laptop . the price was just right . i highly recommend this company to do business with . tell them elias sent you .
after misunderstanding communication , i got a call message from the manager who did took care of the issue i had . better later than never . i will give it a try and update my review.
one of the first places i found to have ramen . the cold chuka style ramen is just like what you find it in tokyo . in the hot ramen the soup is quite rich and they serve it with an amazing soft boiled egg . a great place for a casual meal by yourself or with a group . they also have big meat dishes served family style , which isn t quite japanese , but is also very popular . all the portions are hearty . so make sure to go there hungry .
great pizza , lots of options and fresh ingredients an no grease . enjoyed the portion size for the price it s worth it . also in a up and coming location in southwest .
great food . just recently found it and been there three times a week since . love their phad thai both traditional and curry . service is friendly but when ordering over the phone mistakes occur . will recommend to a friend with passion .
nice place a bit older but expected . cool water features and the bass pro shop attachment is nice . ok beverage service i guess i dont really recall getting a drink .
dude was the biggest dick ive ever met . rude as hell for no reason . literally never going back .
this place needs new machines . i guess you do get what you pay for . staff doesn t seem to know what they are doing half of the time . spacious place , its pretty basic in here.
coming from a seasoned employee , i would say this job was the worst job i have ever had . they put people in management that should not be in management . they re culture is to put people down because they are above you . do not work at this place and i will never get a loan here . the way employers treat their employees means everything to me now . crazy and unorganized management !
beautiful arrangement made on the morning of the wake for a close friend . they did a beautiful job with the flower arrangement and for a reasonable price . definitely will call them again !
what a hassle i thought as i walked into the men s wearhouse to get fitted for the rental ( i m a groomsman in my sisters wedding )  . i was in for a pleasant surprise . stan , a professional with decades of experience , made it so quick and easy , i could hardly believe it . it s usually a hassle trying on clothing at my current weight , but stan did an awesome job .
the best ramen in charlotte . hands down . ingredients are incredibly fresh and flavorful . this is literally one of my favorite restaurants in the entire city .
very good prices . the meat is prepared well . the only complaint is the rice . it s kind of stale and flavorless . other than that these guys have perfected quick sit down middle eastern food for charlotte standards .
chipotle this restaurant of yours is not good . i would put up with the slow , apathetic service if your food was worth it . now that i m out of gift cards , we won t be back .
honestly one of the best massages i ve had in quite some time . they are also very affordable we felt we received more than our money s worth . we were able to walk in without an appointment they took amazing care of us . this is definitely my new go to spot !
just found out this place is closed for business . too bad , i never got to go with the new pup . jack s is next door and allows dogs outside ( on leashes )  . can t go wrong with jackalope s .
i wanted to surprise my husband with new cushions for his mission style chair . so obviously i could take the old ones . i measured as best i could and brought those measurements . i picked out a beautiful leather vinyl that will hold up very well and the cushion is very sturdy . the cushions were perfect . they fit snugly and are very comfortable . the seams and zipper have excellent workmanship . if you need any cushions , in or outdoors come here . you will not be disappointed .
service , food location was great . we shared brasserie poutine , cassoulet croque madame all super yummy . overall great experience . would definitely go back recommend to others .
jill vavro is the best especially with first time buyers and anxious realtors . she went above and beyond . she really cares and it shows .
a hidden gem that is right down the street from us . they have happy hour for drinks all day on sunday . lots of specials throughout the week . their wings are awesome and service was good . i was also very impressed dave , the owner , came out to greet us since it s a was our first time there . great atmosphere . we will be back !
fenomenal place . savory french treats and delicious croissants , the crepes are amazing and the business owners are very friendly and hospitable . a true gem of a place and a great addition to the biltmore fashion park and greater phoenix area . you have to try it !
simply the best gelato in las vegas hands down . we ve tried many others in town but nothing comes close !
here is my concise review . mac and cheese , great . olives appetizer also fabulous . sandwiches , pretty good . beer and wine good . service terrific . unfortunately the acoustics of the room we were seated in were not so good . in other words it was loud and difficult to hear my wife s conversation . perhaps something can be done to absorb the noise ( for instance some well placed cloth wall hanging might help )  . overall , we had a good experience and would go again .
chino bandido is one of my go to spits . absolutely love it . i will recommend it to everyone i know . it s a must try for sure .
my family and i ate at yia sou for the first time on sunday this week , picked up gyros on tuesday and brought coworkers for lunch on wednesday . i think i m obsessed . melt in your mouth calamari , fantastic greek salad , fresh and delicious tzatziki and a huge mound of pretty good octopus . everything i ve had so far has been fresh and portions are generous . i m looking forward to trying just about everything on the menu !
i ve clearly never really had thai food before , because this was easily the best thai meal i ve ever had . maybe my experiences have been super lackluster , but i d rather think chada is just that damn good . i went for the second time last night with a group and everything was fantastic once again . particular stand outs were the duck , both soft shell crab dishes , the lettuce cups , fresh oysters and pad thai , easily the best pad thai i ve ever tasted . just phenomenal !
place is good for fast food , clean inside . friendly staff.
super slow service for lunch , patio lame , looking at concrete and traffic , much nicer patios in the area , carne asada tacos were good , katie the bartender was excellent . overall , an average experience .
this place is hit or miss with service and food . today the food was great and service was good . i don t get the negative reviews your hear for the wings with a good looking waitress otherwise you would be at hooters . there was no wait time in line and the kitchen was fast today . still the best hooters out of the three in las vegas.
two of us had facials and they were both amazing . the ambiance was soothing , the esteticians were thorough and pleasant ( stacy and sky incredible )  , and even the shuttle in a very clean and smooth denali was enjoyable . definitely a high recommendation !
best calzones in the city . possibly state , maybe even country . whenever i m home in cleveland , getting a calzone from degaetano s is a priority . other food based priorities include a sub from dave s , and a pita from tommy s . cleveland has a ton of these little gems i do sometimes really miss these spots !
i was here and liked the place a lot . food , ambience , service . all seemed good . although my friend didn t like her cold coffee much . but overall it is a nice place with good crowd . will return .
this restaurant is now closed in order to renovate and develop a new concept .
other worldly , celestial , quesadillas cut from the genes of god himself . this food belongs in museums with the likes of rembrandt . awesome owner , sweet aesthetics hidden just right .
good food , fun vegan and vegetarian choices . the sweet and spicy cornbread filling in an enchilada is amazing . thumbs up .
my husband is visiting a new client in phoenix so we decided to explore scottsdale restaurants . we are so glad we decided to dine at black bleu . the hostess natasha was delightful and friendly . our server shannon was truly amazing , always showing up when we needed something . we even met brandon the owner . now , about the food: the ribeye was cooked exactly to taste and the vegetable medley was steamed perfectly . we didn t make it to dessert because we were too full . maybe next time !
i enjoyed the food . only complaint is that the tables are little to close to each other ( wall booth tables )  . aside from that i like it !
this place is tasty but you will wait an excessive amount of time for your order . the restaurant is managed by high schoolers early college age staff . they are experts at quoting inaccurate times as well as being generally rude to customers . you would expect fine customer service at the biltmore but unfortunately whoever owns this establishment takes no pride in customer service or their staff .
great experience . used coupon from valpak . hadn t had a cleaning in awhile and the entire staff from amber at the front desk , to grace who took the ex rays , to sommer the hygienist , to dr . seto were extremely friendly and very professional . tv s with your choice of channels in every room . enjoyed talking football with sommer . overall great value and great service . highly recommend .
i absolutely love this location i dreaded bringing my one year old and two year old in to mail three packages and they had their own set up for kids with a table and chairs and crayons and coloring pages he also gave my kids bubbles and paper airplanes it was completely painless and i love how easy and friendly it it was this is definitely our new shipping go to.
wow . had etienne do my makeup and hair . i didn t know it was possible to look this pretty . he made me feel comfortable , and made me feel confident . the salon was very busy and had a new york feeling about it . i would come here again and again .
got the fried chicken cutlet and loved it . the spice combination was really intriguing and they kept it toasty in an insulating blanket . yet to try the bubble tea but will be back to do so !
food was alright , but let s be real here . service is everything . the whole reason to dine out is to be served and taken care of . bald dude with glasses clearly does not know how to offer this . when a table asks for something , you say yes and do it . no one wants to hear your excuses and your flat out no . give the table what they want . period .
i m officially in love . the soup dumplings are little balls of liquidy heaven . the pot stickers are also my jam . it has definitely become our go to place when we venture into the city ( since we are typically stuck in a suburban chain restaurant nightmare )  .
the food was amazing as well as the service . there was no line so we got in there pretty quick . everything we had to eat was fresh and there was a wide selection of desserts . i will definitely come back again .
always a good time at the rogue bar . come here pretty frequently where my boyfriend plays their open mic on wednesday nights . good vibes , cheap booze , and a very graffiti ized bathroom . the people are always friendly and the bartenders are awesome . would definitely recommend for a fun night out to see some music and to throw back some pbrs and brown bag shots obviously .
came here for dinner . geez , no one bothered to greet us , seat us or act like we existed . waited long enough finally gave up left . take your business eat where they welcome customers . these people could care less.
i had the thai basil ( vegan )  and the honey i m home ( vegan version )  . so delicious . that honey i m home had my cravings going for weeks !
pretty cool . won t take long . good to visit on your first day here to get a lay of the land .
such a fun place to go dance or just hang out with friends they have good music and lots of other things to do .
avenue b is worth going to . the menu is creative and diverse and tasty . there s a good vibe here and the owners work hard to keep things on point .
full of flavor . only take away was that the waitress was a little busy so she didn t get my order . overall , the food is delicious though . the place is very lively . the ambience definitely fits guy s tv personality .
after a recent visit here i was pleasantly surprised by the menu options of lighter mexican fare . they have tons of sauces to chose from , wide range of tacos which can be turned into bowls as well as appetizers . try the brussel sprout nachos . a weird but delish twist on one of my fave snack foods . drinks are good but pricey . try to make it for happy hour . and check in on yelp , they have a great deal on beer and a taco . love the back patio . stays cool enough to dine outside in the summer months . will be back .
low end thrift shopping at its best . cheap . cheap . cheap thats the way we like it.
a must see in vegas . if you love the beatles music , you will love this production . couldn t get better than this !
soooooo disappointed . as others had mentioned the onion rings are horrible . just rings of grease . the actual hot dog and burger were tasty . but bread and stuff not so much . i ve had better root beer . odd after taste . we gave you a try . there is potential .
the food is delicious . the best crepes . i had the grand prix and vanilla maple for dessert . incredible food , good presentation . i only knocked down one star ( and wish i could have done a half star )  because the coffee in the carafes wasn t great . when i go back i ll try some of their espresso .
tried their crepe cakes ( vanilla and green tea )  and both were delicious . a little pricey for my liking but would be a nice treat once in a while .
what mexican restaurant doesn t serve tostadas , well this establishment doesn t fyi . the tacos were just like any other mexican restaurant . this was my bf pick . should you ever visit san diego go to el camals totally authentic mexican food . 
stopped in for a quick drink and was pleasantly surprised . the specialty martinis are tasty and the atmosphere is inviting . the bartenders are friendly and helpful . the only downfalls are the location and lack of food . they do give you peanut butter pretzels so it s not all bad .
came for happy hour during the world series . ordered individual entrees from the menu . awesome food . salty fries . love .
we are using the preschool program here . my child loves her teacher and us parents love the way the program focuses on different things each week . what a wonderful school so happy it was built so close to our house . thank you legacy schools . we look forward to both our kids progressing through your program !
our favorite place in las vegas . excellent food . the chicken and waffles are amazing .
i am reviewing this based on the chicken tikka masala . i haven t ordered anything else on the menu and i really don t think i need to . this dish is fantastic . i have been to this place multiple times and if this is an accurate description of indian food than i am a fan !
the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating . they have a wonderful selection of vegan entrees and they re all really tasty .
omg . best brisket in az . its unreal . we got a tour of the smokers by the father of the guy who runs the business . it was really fun to chat and even get some tips on being a better smoker myself . it was really cool and very very nice people .
great atmosphere and food was excellent . too small of a location though . very crowded .
this is a great dimsum place , staff are very attentive . our favorites are the yang chow fried rice , bean curd skin roll and the sharks fin dumpling . don t leave this place without trying their desserts too . the red bean sesame balls are huge and yummy !
best indian food in the entire ohio . absolutely love the curries . the quantities are good and the staff is awesome . try the hara bhara kabab , paneer tikka masala and malai kofta . the naan are soft and freshly made . a must try !
always a treat stopping by for food . so glad to see they are now open on sundays . decided to venture away from my usual choice and try the fajitas . the steak and shrimp fajitas were fantastic , and even better with tecate . the gaucamole was great as well , and i m not much of a guacamole eater . the staff is always great no matter who you get . love the villa .
they re closing for lunch and dinner to support a protest in madison . last time i m coming here .
service was absolute trash . the waitress didn t put my friends order in and brought me the wrong food . genuinely wouldn t recommend .
fantastic ambience . some of the best indian food i have ever had . service is top notch . i completely recommend this to anyone who wants to have a truly memorable experience .
great happy hour specials . get the pretzel fondue or the chef s plate . also , their specialty cocktails are amazing . it has a chain feel when it comes to service . but if you just want a good cocktail and some apps , i d try it out .
excellent food , wonderful service and inside was nice and cool , definitely be back !
the service was average . very slow on drink refills . the shrimp and grits were average . i expected something more spectacular . i really feel it wasn t worth the hype or price . i m going back again to give them a second chance .
i m a fan . good food , home style atmosphere and great in the summer for sangria and guacamole !
this place was horrible . lo mein is just boiled noodles , no vegetables or flavoring . you re ordering spaghetti . everything else is almost just as bland and waaaaaaaay over priced for such garbage . i don t understand why they re allowed business in the hotel , nevermind how they have any business at all !
beautiful atmosphere . great for date night , girls night , family dinner or a beautiful brunch . the food was delicious and fresh , definitely can t wait to go back on our next trip to vegas . it s off the strip , but for sure worth the quick detour , so please don t let the location keep you from trying out this hidden gem .
food was outstanding and the staff was very friendly . homemade pita bread and a mediterranean style lemonade made for a delicious lunch .
classic neighborhood dogs . the original fast food . more options than a hot dog stand , but not many .
i get my lashes and eyebrows done by cassi and she does a great job . they last up to two weeks and she offers different options of having them applied . this store is very efficient and they really try their best to get people in and out . very friendly , accommodating and clean .
tried a selection of their taco offerings . the tripas tacos were gaf . they re like little folds of pork cracklin heaven . recommend the frijoles charros . if they offered them in a gallon chug i could chug them all day . i was hungry so i forgot to take a picture but they are simple enough i could ve downed a few more .
i love this place so much better than starbucks with so many unique and unheard of mixes for drinks . the two young ladies working this morning were so sweet and personable unlike the other location we go to . i will def be coming to this location more often . the red velvet blended and the chunky monkey iced are amazing !
i took a couple pair of shoes there because somebody recommended them to me . i think they did an ok job . i did have to take one pair back for some follow up work .
what a great experience for the family . brett wayde were unbelievably welcoming for photos and autographs . enjoyed the tour . highly recommended .
i went to personal touch for the first time a little over a week ago . i m so glad i did . josh cut and colored my hair and now everyone tells me it s the best my hair has ever looked ( and it really is )  . i am very happy with my decision !
freddy s has a delicious patty melt , and their shoestring fries are crispy and flavorful when dipped in a mix of their fry sauce and a packet of chululu hot sauce . atmosphere is fast food clean .
great people great food and fast . we ve been here a few times before very good food . try the pineapple frappe !
went for brunch here last weekend . the food was food but super rich so it was hard to eat the whole thing . i ordered mimosas which were almost bottomless they brought a carafe full of the mimosa and the mimosa just tasted like only orange juice . wasn t that impressed with everything over , just wasn t bad either .
yummy , tender , well seasoned chicken , generously sized lumpia , and friendly owners plus it is in a truck . how can you not like it . a phillipino news crew was at the phx public mkt the other day filming them they re that good .
i had a yummy almond milk late while my husband had an iced coffee that he enjoyed . if you are looking for savory items , they don t have it . but kids had a protein bar and a brownie which they enjoyed . will definitely go back for the coffee.
if you have eagle eyes then you can spot this american eagle in my picture . i like it better than abercrombie although i m not sure why . i haven t worn stuff from them for a while now , but i still pop in here when i m dragged in here . me and my ohio girl checked out this whole mall and this was one of her favorite stores . the employees are always nice , but i don t like the clothes here . they re expensive and pretty boring .
the food was delicious . the place is romantic , classy and comfortable . i really enjoyed my dinner there . the service was just perfect . it s a nice place to go for a special occasion or on a date . i will come back for sure !
awesome wings when charred on the grill . my son loved the grilled cheese bacon sandwich , my burger was delivered fast and delicious as was the sweet sweet potato fries . best part of the meal was by far the friendly service . we will be sure to make this a regular place to eat !
glo medspa is the only spa i will go to , charles is so good at injections and he takes his time with each procedure . i am thrilled with my results . go see him , he will be fair and honest .
by far the worst starbucks ever . they constantly mess up orders forgetting milk or what not . there are so many homeless people inside drinking milk or outside trying to clean your window or ask for money for bed at salvation army . and now they randomly have a sign saying they are closed in drive through . wtf .
food and drinks were really good . service was abysmal . took forever to be greeted , even longer to take our order . did not get our drinks from the bar until our food was delivered . never checked back on us to see how we were doing . just dropped off the check . really made the whole experience disappointing .
food was not that great and the beer was warm and your in vegas it should be cold . the waitress was not very nice had to get a refill on drinks .
amazing find . enjoy fresh spicy healthy soups . ravi hits the spot . vegetarian options . compassionate meat choices . don t be put off by the casual atmosphere: ravi is simple and splendid . ( bonus: if you have a cold , just what the doctored ordered .  ) .
was going to place my order here after hearing from the manager but when i contacted him about it again never heard back . went with competitor instead .
really good hainan chicken . solid pho ( that s more like a thai style bun bo hue ) .
this show was borderline cheesy and raunchy perfection for any bride to be . some of the routines were a little out there ( think tarzan )  and some where straight out of magic mike . be aware though the performers run jump grind on the tables so clear them . my phone almost got crushed by a couple of firefighters .
came on sunday lunch for all you can eat . very satisfied with the quality of food and service . their hand rolls are really good . not like typical ayce sushi stuffed with rice and small portion of fish . salmon belly was mouth watering . would definitely come back again . good value of money .
this place doesn t have the friendliest reception and the lobby always reeks of cigarettes every time i come in . this can t be good for the pet s health that come in or their owner s . i have had good experiences with the vet techs they are usually very friendly and approachable . i have felt somewhat rushed during my appointments before when trying to explain things to the vet or ask questions . overall my experiences here haven t been terrible but the place could use some improvements .
as a fan of this franchise , i was highly dissapointed in tonights experience . please hire experienced waitstaff and bartenders . really quite sad to not know the simple things , like what a chilled shot is . especially when purchasing premium priced liquors . manager questioned if i paid my tab after complaining mildly . pure moronic experience . just absurd having this incredibly rude manager chase me down to ask if i paid my tab . will be letting all my norterra folks know to avoid this location .
i know it s busy and all but my double double had burnt things in my burger . really gross in and out . typically all in and out is super clean . apparently this one is the exception .
i would like to thank the dearest individuals i had the great fortune of meeting yesterday while enrolling for the upcoming real estate course at berkshire and hathaway office . i arrived without an appointment and was warmly greeted by tamara and krystal . tamara assisted me with my enrollment forms , payment for books and emails that i should have sent prior to enrolling while answering nonstop phone calls assisting brokers in the office and restocking supplies . thank you tamara and krystal for your beautiful energy and delightful exchange with me . i look forward to seeing you both again soon and starting my class next month .
this is what sonic should taste like . everything was very good . the service was friendly . i still have to deduct a star because for some odd reason , sonic food is good but never hot .
spent new year s eve at drai s and was thoroughly impressed . we had a private section that included an indoor area and several cabanas reserved for our group , which included bottle service and a premium viewing area for both fireworks off site and the performer on site . the club itself is gorgeous . i loved the cabanas outside and the plush couches inside . our servers were very friendly and extremely helpful . the entertainer for the night was running late , but i didn t really care too much . i still had a great time partying . 
love that they have a vegan menu . the veggie salad was delicious and so are their fries . great place to come have brunch if you are in vegas . lots of choices to pick from . you can enjoy your lunch outside on the terrace by the pool !
took my boys in for a haircut and rich did an excellent job on all three of my boys . he was very personable to them , he made them feel at ease . they were so happy . the shop is very clean and i will be a returning customer . i will be recommending vip barbershop to all my family and friends . thank you again for your service rich . 
the midweek burger special is out of this world . cozy downstairs , fun upstairs for darts pinball pool .
this is one of my fav restaurants in pittsburgh . it is a sophisticated yet relaxing , intimate setting and the food matches . great for a celebratory splurge dinner or a higher end lunch . their chipotle rubbed pork loin is to die for . and i am not even really a pork loin fan but it is prepared perfectly . moist , tender and oh so flavorful . treat yourself and enjoy . 
these is probably the worst apartments i ve lived in . many issues pool always closed they don t lock laundry room doors clothes get stolen . manager connie is a catty person and needs to learn people and will nit pick at everything . they are never willing to work with you .
my husband and i love malaya and have become regulars . the food is very good , the staff has always been nice and helpful , the prices are reasonable ( especially for sushi )  and several times when we went there , the owner checked on us . the atmosphere is laid back , which we like . also nice: they do have free parking . we love malaya !
the good: the toast . served in moderately sized cubes rather than in brick form . this gives it more surface area for that sweet toasty crunch . both the honey and nutella versions were really really good . the bad: limited seating we had honey toast , nutella toast , nutella waffle , chocolate gelato , and watermelon latte .
headed into potts barber to get spring clean up . mark took great care of me . love the professionalism an true commitment to craft . awesome haircut and straight razor shave . hot facial towels .
what a great restaurant for date night and family . growing up in the south most of life , this place is nostalgic for me . i can enjoy shrimp and grits , fried catfish , and some excellent jambalaya . prices can be a little high , but it ll be worth the authenticity !
so delicious . the lady who helped me was extremely nice and walked me through the process . i wasn t sure how to order and she helped me pick a great mix of flavors . nice people . the ambiance it s not fancy because it s in a grocery store , but there are chairs and a few little tables you can sit at . this was so good i am definitely going to bring back some friends and family .
the best wax i have ever had . had a brow and lip was they used hard wax ( i think that s what it s called )  so there are no fabric strips . just let dry and rip off . this is actually perfect for shorter hair grow so you should have to go back less . also a very cute little store with body care products , and assessories . go and go now . it s worth every penny .
i had no idea what this type of dish was before i walked in their door . and it smelled divine . i asked the young lady behind the counter what she recommended and tried the achari paneer . delicious . not too spicy amd perfect with the side dishes i also tried the channa mereya ve and oof . spicy . super yummy but glad for the yogurt lol . i really enjoyed this meal and will be back for more .
great church . priest is engaging . kids learn so much from the religious education that they offer here . they don t make it difficult to enroll your kids , even if you re from a different parish . i m definitely changing our home parish here . i drive from summerlin to go here every sunday . i plan on baptizing our baby here , once he or she arrives .
loved the old school vegas environment . loved the indoor bonfire surrounded by water even more . was not too pleased with the omelet . tasted bland . i nicely complained . they took it off my bill . without me even asking . that s great service . i would totally go back for drinks and the pancakes or waffles . totally a throw back to what vegas used to be . i loved it !
blanca was very helpful this morning when i came in to order my food . she took my info down for the free birthday meal . the food was prepared pretty quick considering there was a few orders ahead of me . finally , the food review . i ll keep it short . it was on point . i will definitely be returning . we usually order mexican food from a taco shop down the road , but after eating here today we have our new food joint .
saturday s here are living proof that humans are dumb .
the place overall is super cute and i had a great first time experience . i had shi pu thread my eyebrows and it was very painless not like the other places i have been to . will be coming back : ) .
this place has some authentic mexican tacos . highly recommended . will definitely come here again when i return to vegas .
need an impressive last minute gift or a well planned thought out gift that will make you look like a star . this is the place you want on speed dial . owner alina poletskova is very friendly and after asking a few questions she is able to create for customers one of a kind creations . step inside her store and you will be exposed to the best flower selection in the midwest .
i was surprised with how many tree cutting services there are in this town , but i guess i shouldn t have been . estimates for the job i requested varied greatly and aron s was quite reasonable . communication was very good thanks to jenifer and it was easy to schedule an appointment . the crew arrived on time and was professional and courteous . they did a very good job and cleaned up afterwards . i absolutely recommend them and will come back as a repeat customer .
awesome ramen . very friendly staf . simple menu . not salty at all . rice bowl was pretty good too . and the ice cream macaroon . yum .
large portions . nice italian food . quick service . pleasant experience overall . i d definitely go back.
dustin and kevin went above and beyond to get my back windshield replaced . amazing customer service and no more worries about driving with a shattered windshield . i am so grateful great honest people great experience and highly recommended !
another great dinner . the shish taouk was extremely good and the kibbe balls were amazing . ab and his wife do a great job !
emerald chicken was great . they have a line where you can do taste testing and the price and service were great . the eating area is nothing over the top .
love stopping by here everytime we visit toronto . been coming here since i was a kid . cheap and filling . it does get warm in here in the summer . awesome huge aloe plants in the front window .
had an awesome time on the land yacht . awesome sound system , dj , bar and bartender were great , good music , awesome views , and convenience of a restroom on board . spacious . and the owners are great . highly recommend experiencing this !
i always go to this auto zone because they have pretty good service overall and a friendly well informed staff . they have most parts for most cars . compared to the other auto zones i been to , this one exceeds my expectations .
nice atmosphere , courteous staff , and yummy treats all bundled up under one roof . i ve been going to this place for years now and have never been disappointed with service . my only criticism is that their selection of cookies , and traditional persian pastry has shrunk over the past couple of years and has become very generic , though the quality is still good but i still find myself wanting to to to other places for variety .
loved it . want to go back and see it again . hopefully next time i don t have a guy next to me yapping away on the phone .
dr . rehl is simply the best . he took his time and explained all my test results and was very thourough when talking about all my options , etc . he really cares about each patient . i will be referring all my family members to him . 
great little wine and beer bar . laid back and casual . good decor and waitstaff . we ll be back : ) .
ate there for lunch today with a friend . i got the chicken enchiladas and she got the chicken tacos and they were both very good , i really like their spanish rice too . i am glad there s a new place to eat in downtown mesa .
this is a nice little cafe with great service . has a homie feel . deff recommend if you are in the city . the people won t let you down .
although the food was ok , for the same price you might as well go to a ayce sushi spot which will allow more variety . not saying anything negative , the food at rollnation was good , but trendy and quality must not be confused .
the spicy shrimp with mixed vegetables are super yummy . beef lo mein was a bit disappointing although the noodles were flavorful . overall , the jade palace is a bit pricey for takeout but worth the price if dining in .
fun atmosphere , good place to watch football games . i like the cheese curds !
busy busy place , and for good reason , this is the gold standard for beer and bar food . recommend head hunter if you like your beer hoppy . but there is a choice for everyone in beer and food . the classic reuben is honestly one of the best i have had . pulled pork anything will be great also . the smoked wings are the best . mmmm mmm.
quality has gone down . besides the live cooking stations . everything else is pretty stale . even the chinese food from the fried rice to general tao chicken is stale . it s like been frozen than microwave and put back out . thumbs down to this place.
good but not great . wall of pepperoni is about as much as you would expect on a normal order , it s certainly not double . marinara sauce is a little tangy .
i love janey s . the service is always friendly and it has a great vibe . it s a great place to bring my computer and camp out for a while doing work that would be far less fun without this spot . every time i m in town i come here , and it makes me forget that i m not a local .
i was having a jyajyanmyun craving and this place s jyajyanmyun was on point . the hosts were really nice and kept on providing refills of kimchi . their chicken musubi was also decent .
best buffet ever . good quality food , awesome service . they don t like the traditional low quality low price chinese buffet , omg i cannot really think of another place who can beat this . this place is a must go . 
this location is the best little caesars i ve been to . the pizza is always hot and ready . the cashier is very nice and friendly .
terrible customer service . i made an appointment over the phone and it somehow was not recorded in the schedule .
so impressed with this place . the broth is very flavorful , didn t need much hoisin sauce or hot sauce . and the meat to noodle ratio is on point . they definitely don t skimp out on the meat , from quality and quantity . the service is good , they refill our water glasses constantly . only gripe is they put a ton of ice in your iced coffee . but this is truly a hidden gem !
very good egg sandwich , tasty and with a bunch of options . a bit more greasy than i would have liked it , but the buns are definitely a hit . on the negative sides: this restaurant is located inside a very crowded mall , and it s loud and they have very little seating . the lines to order food are also insanely long .
breakfast was great . a bargain at the price . spacious seating . eggs were moist , not dried out . sticky rice . 
had a great time here last night with friends . great vibe , good cocktails . the pork taco was fantastic , and so was the banana ice cream .
if you re a nascar fan , this place is great . love carl edwards !
i specifically went to this store to get a hold of a messenger bag( a necessity for anyone who takes the ttc )  , lo and behold when i got there a whole section dedicated to messenger bags . although it didn t have exactly what i was looking for , i found something that more than adequately did the job . so i came to realize , if your looking for decent quality , fair prices , and many choices this would be the place to checkout .
newly renovated . close to bedford side of st george station , good to have a cheap coffee in the neighborhood.
we go here fairly often as it is just down the street from our place . service is always so good and consistently great food and vibe . i love the salmon and the burgers but the cocktails are great and so are the desserts . great place to go before suns or diamondback games or whatever takes you downtown .
this place is whack . over priced and the quality of food is weak my wife each got a carnie asiata burrito and it was not up to par with robert s taco shop no cheese and more rice then meat wtf , you guys need to step it up .
chef matt is amazing . not only is the food amazing but the chef is down to earth and humble . nice man who cares about his customers and wants to make sure you enjoyed every bite . i ve never seen a chef come out to greet his customers and even fill up drinks . the whole staff had amazing service . we will be back .
great food , especially the veggies and always a friendly attentive staff.
great menu , friendly staff and even though part of a chain they are unique . only a few items with soy otherwise everything is fantastic . best raw restaurant in durham !
this place is awesome . pizza is delicious and the owners were so welcoming as if i had been coming here for years . i will be back here for sure !
so i have to say this place was a little hard to find at first but eventually i located it right next to the lucky store . i was so glad i found it because my daughter needed the mal costume from descendants . the girls here were so helpful in finding us everything we needed and helped us with dressing rooms sizing etc . even got the spray for her hair etc . this store was much bigger than i anticipated and they have a lot of items . it s decorated really nicely as well .
it may be in a weird location for a pub , but you ll be surprised once you get in nice spacious tables , fast and friendly service , and a generally older and polite crowd just enjoying a couple of drinks with friends or family . there are no noisy party people here which for me , is great . also , been having difficulty finding hoegaarden in other bars , but st . james has it cheers to that . was also very happy with my guinness ribs . will definitely be back for more !
fantastic in every way imaginable . a feast for both your eyes as well as tastebuds with authentic dishes from various regions of iran made to perfection . highly recommend paying attention to unique daily specials , where rare gems are often found .
good bagels for a reasonable price . the onion bagels were a bit well done ( making the onion a little bitter )  but otherwise very tasty . they are great on their own but also go well with cream cheese . i was impressed that the bagels weren t rock hard the morning after purchasing , like many bagels i have tried from other places become .
i had cheese steak with mushroom . it was good enough to definitely visit again . i will always get takeout because the inside looks depressing . cashier could be more friendly but i guess i interrupted her phone conversation and cigarette smoke break . oh well . so i went back that night and got another one for my hubby , it was terrible . i guess its all who is cooking it that makes the difference .
a great little spot on west side . you can create ice cream or tea from a variety of flavors and combinations . both the ice cream and boba teas are delightful . f.
absolutely fantastic service for a bachelorette . tony was on point . super responsive while planning , had knowledgable and thoughtful suggestions , and was super professional on the day of our event . i couldn t have asked for a better experience . thank you , tony : ) .
a lot of hype for this place and decided to try it out . i love the eggs just cooked enough to have a little yolk in the middle . super yummy egg but the sandwich was an average cheeseburger . the oj didn t seem to be freshly squeezed and it wasn t that cold.
some of the best falafel i had in a while . in town for a quick lunch off peak hours . abundant portions , very good salad . i wasn t fond of the fries but everything else was great . the staff was very friendly . i will visit again for sure .
the seared tuna with cilantro and jalapeno hummus is to die for . i always try to seat outside ( unless is too hot )  , i found the inside to be too dark . price is good , service is good , food is good , doesn t get better than that !
i like the service . the waiter is super polite and patient . i had the salt chicken rice and my friend had braised rork rice . it has good portion for girls . nice bubble tea with reasonable price . will def go again .
the pho is the bomb . bahn mi is pretty solid . well worth the price considering the closest vietnamese spot is in charlotte .
full disclosure but my daughter goes to the paul michelle school and can i please tell you the place is immaculate . the people couldn t have been more helpful and nice . the cut wasn t bad at all and the teacher was right . there to help the student the whole time . awesome experience and did some good .
la capella is a great spot carved into the old phar mor in the waterworks . why their pizza doesn t make it on pittsburgh s list of the best pizza is beyond me . their sicilian crust with pepperoni , mushroom , basil , and roasted red peppers is amazing .
great haircut professional service razor , hot towel and massage included in a low price . what more could you ask for ?.
ate here while in town for spring training . it was fabulous . i had the scallops and my husband had the pork chop . both were great . good service . great location and fun vibe in the restaurant .
i went to frilly lily for the first time today . it s a lovely little house and the decor inside is gorgeous . the staff there are awesome . i highly recommend this establishment . 
the quality of pizza is good and the price is reasonable . we ordered pizza from here a few times and we were satisfied in total .
was recommended by a friend just yesterday . i can honestly say that this was the best shrimp pad thai that i ve had . i will definitely be back . very friendly and courteous .
great food . i have been to many taco bell s . this one by far has the best service i have had at any fast food restaurant . i ate inside the restaurant which was very clean . the employees that i saw were very pleasant and smiling .
i went there today with my wife after having seen this place in yelp . so far we ve only had the caramelized croissant and the shepherds pie but i can tell from the quality of the pastry that pretty much everything they have there is going to be great . we brought some more varieties of croissants home which will try later . we will be back many times to work our way through the entire menu .
good men s wearhouse , staff seemed to know what they were doing . they were all nice the woman there was nice and understanding of everything i wanted . they had slim and non pleated pants . they seemed to have more classy looking things than weirder tuxedos so i wouldn t go there for an orange or baby blue tux . overall really good.
biggest korean bakery in vegas . huge selection of breads and pastries . small mom and pops kinda feel here . seating is limited . i got individual bhang ( bread )  to last me a few days . i pop them in the microwave so they are nice and warm . i love carbs !
beautiful ambience . excellent service . great portions and the food looked great . only problem the beef teriyaki was too salty for my liking . my wife ordered the general tao chicken and felt the same way . surprising . because this place generally excels in terms of food .
allina makes your experience here just perfect . she makes you feel as though you ve known her for years . very relaxing atmosphere and very professional . highly , highly , highly , recommended .
this place is super cute . i got the roasted chicken salad a chocolate chip cookie sammich and was pleased with both ( though the cookie sammich was a bit sweet for me , but i don t usually eat sweets )  . service was fast and the atmosphere was calm for lunch hour , so it was a nice get away from the office .
always fast service , very friendly staff . they have the best lo mein around . although we didn t get it this time , we have the sushi before and it is very good . and friendly sushi chef .
great sandwich . got the james harrison . fries are crispy . kid s chicken tenders were tasty . lots of choices . plus build your own .
i like the burgers here . they make them fresh each day , so they aren t from frozen . the desserts here are also great . this location is a test restaurant so the menu changes often .
i tried this place cause my friend recommended it highly and i was not impressed . the food was mediocre and the atmosphere plain . they have unusual items , which i tried and it wasn t very tasty , just blah . i won t be going back .
i eat subway at least three times a week for lunch . however i will never return to this location . the employees seem like they re there more to have a good time then to make sandwiches and the vegetables look like they have been out for days . who wants a sandwich with brown lettuce . if you do i just found the restaurant for you .
this location has a really beautiful , european styled interior . i loved the ambience . i got their short ribs on rice and a chocolate croissant . compared to the other location , the food is not as good and they give you less :(  but they have a wider variety of baked goods and desserts , which makes coming to this place a bit more worthwhile .
i have been going here for several years now and i don t plan on leaving anytime soon . it took me so long to find an ob gyn that i actually liked . dr . margaret , front staff and nurses are all wonderful . i always have struggled with doctors offices not returning my phone calls and paradise valley ob gyn is always very responsive and extremely helpful in all situations .
always good . like the menu . drinks are small for the price . overall it s a safe bet .
beautiful building , perfect for a romantic date . service is attentive , friendly , and professional . food is high quality . the menu is based on a four course dinner and you pick your options for each course .
nice hotel rooms were big with all the normal amenities . the clean remote was a plus encouraged by the fact the remote might have been cleaned in between users . the complimentary breakfast is decent good enough to start your day .
we were shocked by rude behavior . when calling to confirm reservation as one always should when booking online , my husband was meet with a very rude response from reception , she refused to take confirmation number or allow my husband to speak with manager . very bad first impression if this is the way they treat guests not sure we want to stay here . have never been treated so badly and we travel a lot .
we love this korean restaurant . they have all of the foods my husband was raised on and they are all authentic to taste . we go here or order it to go at least once a month . fast service and always accurate . in addition , they have kimchee in bulk that my husband and daughter just love and it is inexpensive . great place !
best free thing to do in las vegas . go at dusk .
close to us bank nice place to have coffee in the morninng . not crowded . they also have small area outside but no drive thru .
great selection for a healthy lunch option buried in a casino . as always the food at a wolfgang puck venue was excellent , even with a simple chicken sandwich . service was wonderful and nice to get out of the casino traffic . next trip i ll try the pizza as it looked fabulous !
wonderful service at a reasonable price . mr . segura does a thorough job and is prompt and consistent . couldn t ask for more .
great new locally owned thai restaurant . the patio with fire pits and open bar are awesome . great atmosphere and food . i highly recommend . chao !
this really is a nice salon . the nail technicians are nice and the price is reasonable . i also get my hair cut and colored there . their cosmos are good , solid quality without inflated prices . just last week i had two ladies take pictures of my hair to show their cosmo to duplicate . what a nice compliment . i really do love simply ravishing salon .
when they kick you out for commenting on their drinks . served water when asked for vodka soda . first drink i could tell it was water.
went to the new jack s on broadway priest . the tomato on the buttery jack wash disgusting !
clean store , friendly vibe , just didn t have a good selection of men s clothing to make me want to return . they do have an over abundance of sport jerseys and if that s your thing , check it out .
le tigre is a cool neighborhood spot , especially if you love tigres . i always think it s a little too dark in there , but maybe that s just me . free popcorn and cash only . and very , very good drinks . great , friendly service . i ll definitely be back !
delicious food . friendly service . cute outfits . good atmosphere . great music . easy to find via monorail .
yum . enchiladas suizas are deeeeeelicious . that s the extent of my order , so i can t opine much more than that . service was excellent , prompt and friendly . i went early on a saturday evening and the place was maybe half full , pretty quiet and relaxed , just the way i like it .
i wanted to really like this place but it just didn t do it for me . my wife and i went for dinner one night and ordered the korean style short ribs and kalua pork . the short ribs were ok nothing special and the kalua pork was barely warm . we probably won t be coming back anytime soon .
the menu is too overwhelming and the food isn t all that great . comparable to a denny s or ihop .
pretty good hardshell tacos filled with cheese yum . cheap food and was not super oily . i think its family owned as well .
first time to culvers but won t be our last . the food was hot , fresh and very tasty . had the double original butterburger and it was delicious could tell it was chargrilled , not processed or frozen . fries were crispy but soft . the chicken tenders and malt were also very good . my daughter loved the green beans side . the staff was very friendly and helpful with great customer service . so glad this location is convenient .
great home burger and fries . it reminds me if how harry s drive thru used to be in scarborough until they came under new ownership .
i brought my in laws here from korea and they said this was the best meal they had on their trip . the food was good . not too oily and tasted great . if you are looking for thai food in the vegas area than this is the place to go . the staff is friendly and helpful .
awesome fresh strawberries and cream and the owner was so sweet . it s in a corner in the plaza and with the drive .
counts kustoms does not stand behind their work , i ll never own another vehicle made by them again .
fast service , friendly staff and tasty cuisine . we decided to skip the hotel free breakfast and venture out . we are very glad we did the breakfast was great .
never trust the survivor . listen to all the clues . flip everything over . enjoy the ride .
delicious food and great service . cute intimate setting good for a date or girls night .
dimsum heaven that is near the strip . it is located inside gold coast hotel . love their new deco and ambiance . they have a great selection of dimsum and chinese food . we enjoyed our meal . it satisfied our dimsum cravings . price is very reasonable . servers were really nice .
if anything i love the csi looking cast in the pharmacy . enhance enhance enhance . dive through is fast just watch out for the intersection coming out . parking lot needs some stop signs . hell it s vegas every where needs them . the photo center has some great staff that can point out how to get the best deals . made a photo book for my parents and it came out fairly decent.
hidden little gem that i would have not known about if it wasn t for my husband doing advance research . love this place . great variety of vinyl and cds . check it out for sure .
pho lacked some of the flavour of a richly built stock . wait staff was great and friendly !
i love this place . especially on wednesdays , which is ladies night dollar drinks . beer pong is super fun with great tables to play on . dance floor is huge and line dancing is fun . they have lessons if you don t know the dances . great atmosphere .
have tried to like this store , but last order was horrendous . a special xl pizza . i m thinking , ok one more try . as usual i was disappointed . the typical papa john s way to save money half crust with very little toppings . pizza was not hot , ok , but it looked like it had been thrown around back seat . very disappointing . only positive is drivers are usually nice . done with these guys .
if you want delicious totally not healthy food this is your spot . try the chicken katsu burger . it s bomb . also huge so bring someone to share otherwise you will be in a food coma . cheap fast and delicious !
if you are looking for a great on time , professional group , and fix your problem right the first time , look no further . i have used and referred jb waters to many people i will continue to do so for the great work they do .
just had dinner here . ordered the special combo plate of falafel , chicken and beef shawarma with salad , humus , and pita . very good authentic taste . the owner is a very kind man who takes the time to treat his guests well . even got complimentary baklava for dessert which was excellent . a bit pricy but worth it and the best mediterrenean food in the area . will be back .
second time at this location . i m always impressed with the staff and service . one of the servers recognized us from a visit months ago and stopped to chat . nice . had something new in the menu , nashville skillet . it looked great on the picture , but not so much when i got it . taste of onions was to overpowering and the eggs seemed juicy . i ate it , but wouldn t get it again .
everything about my meal was great . from the rice to the beans to the meat , the attention to detail is perfect . highly recommended .
my friend is a huge fan of this store so i decided to join her on some shopping . it s a very small store but that s ok because you would have everything you need . i was interested in the bath bombs . the guy working was super friendly and helped me pick some out . i was intrigued with the cupcake face mask but opted out of it but it smelled delicious . 
fantastic food , staff is always very friendly . i like the fact it s an intimate setting and you can hear yourself and have a conversation over great food . the meats are of good quality and plentiful . after all most people do go to a steakhouse for meat . there is virtually no wait time between new meat being offered at the table and they aren t stingy with the portions . i have had lunch and dinner here and both are exceptionally well . the interior is decorated nicely and you could come casual or dressed up . keep up the good work . a definite must eat in henderson .
rich was the best plumber i have ever used . he was knowledgeable , professional , extremely polite , and took his time without taking too much . he will be my go to plumber from here on out !
great drinks good food , hot waitress need i say more.
i live out of town and just happened by this shop . i found them online and booked an appointment via their website . shop looked very clean , they did have a dog roaming around but he was clearly well trained and did not enter the tattooing spaces . the people were super friendly . danny was my artist and he was very pleasant . he did an amazing job with my realistic style tattoo .
this place is an absolute gem . i have never been disappointed and i gladly made the trip to sun prairie for their pizza , even when i live in the middle of a food mecca on willy street . even better now that they have a second location closer to me . everything from the staff to the food is incredible . always clean as well . give small businesses a chance , guys !
they were able to come out the very same day to get my ac running again for a fair price . there was a little hiccup during the repair but the owner contacted me directly and resolved the issue immediatly . i would certainly recomend them for all your hvac needs .
every time i come here , we get the best service by the employees . even the servers on training employees . i love the queso dip , i love this place because the managers are always involved.
pretty consistent spot for lunch . love the daily special price and variety . the tots are great !
the best place for fish fry but on a few times the staff has been rude and rushes people out too fast . the food is great though so that makes up for it .
hands down . the best blt i ever ate . in the italian market of all places.
came shopping with my sister in law and she bought some high knee boots we were told by a guy employee who was kind enough to tell us the real price and when we checked out they charged us more then what the price was . always check online before buying in store !
didn t find much here . a lot of the produce was not marked clearly or at all . the sassy salsa was reasonable and i bought one of those . there were some exotic fruits like tiger melons and the seller advised us on the best way to eat it . very educational but i didnt care for the taste . got to see the worlds smallest chickens which made my day.
came here with the bf in the middle of the day . didn t see any gangsters but i did see some shady people that were hanging around the door that looks like they re on something . we were just picking up some food and the selection and price was okay . we bought our groceries and got outta there . i can totally understand why it d be a bad place to go to after dark .
i made the rounds checking out several barbers in the area and i am very happy to have found eddie . he is great with my flat top and does a precision job every time . i always make an appoint and suggest you do the same .
very very good quick mexican . eat in or drive thru . my favs are the carnitas taco , shredded beef burrito , and the refried beans . food always come out piping hot . we usually get stuff to go as we live in the neighborhood .
chino bandido is like no where you have ever been . being able to get asian style food wrapped in a tortilla with a side of beans and jerk fried rice . simply spectacular .
great breakfast love prices call then or sit in restaurant who comes out really fast waitresses are really nice and polite and professional.
serving the scarborough neighborhood for decades . i ve passed by this place countless times but have never stepped foot into francesca s until this past sunday . don t let the outside fool you , though its exterior may look simple , once you re inside its heaven on earth . well laid out , clean , and friendly like most italian bakeries , all the delicatessan s displayed can be overwhelming , like you re at a candy store . everything is made in house and baked with love . the prices are reasonable and just pure quality . torrone was magnificent . and the quality i found was a tad bit better than novellos . in addition they have an extensive seating area and washroom facilities for its patrons . i will definitely be coming back francesca . arividerci . 
food is good nothing to go out of your way for . pricing is ridiculous though by far the most over priced place i ve seen . the food is ok but not worth the price .
i will update this seeing how things turn out , btw this company knowingly allows some other company single agent to get all their calls . so when you google phone number for leaderone financial you get the phone number for some other guy who answers as some other company name . not very re assuring when you ve sent all your confidential docs to a company . i know leaderone does not control google rank but they continue to do business with that person , obviously it is acceptable to leader one since they have not cut ties .
one of the best pedicures i have ever had . toni is a delight and the results last for weeks . very fun atmosphere with an interesting clientele . 
dianne is amazing . it was my first time ever getting a brazilian and i was super nervous . dianne was so easy to talk to and walked me through the whole wax process before starting . she did an amazing job , i can t wait to go back and see her for my maintenance . she s the only person who will do my waxes from now on . thank you dianne . 
very tasty sushi . tried the pork belly ramen and the pork was delicious . best part was the kids loved their kids dishes . the teriyaki skewers were a hit , but their favorite part was the mochi dessert with pop rocks ( that looked like tobiko )  !
fabulous . tastes like hawaiian authentic poke . yum yum yum . good customer service and it s made to order so super fresh .
i had flu symptoms and my other half took me to urgent care . i was in and out quickly with prescriptions in hand . i liked the doctor better than my regular physician . very pleased with the care i ve received here .
loved their bottomless mimosas . their breakfast was great too would def go back to try out other dishes . the service was good and always made sure our cups were full !
the lasagne was awful . who puts shredded beef in lasagne . the salmon cakes were very dry , and the salad that came with them was soaked in a terrible dressing . been there before and food was good , so this was a surprise and big disappointment .
i love this place it has good products and also great customer service . i can also understand how the policy was put up for security reasons . : ) .
this is one of the best in vegas . i prefer betting here they are so friendly and professional . they have teaser cards and great odds . plus the food here is great and if you use your players card when placing bets you will receive free night stays , buffets and other great comps and giveaways . a truly old school touch of las vegas.
really great food and service was terrific although a little slow . you need to call staff over as they don t come around unless you flag them down . was not busy when we were there but heard that most nights there is a wait . had the braised pork with rice and chicken cutlet with noodles . both portion were generous . the green tea shaved ice was amazing . was huge but light and refreshing . would definitely go again .
i have been going here since i was a child ( and it hasn t changed at all )  . i loved it then and i still love it now . my favorite dishes are the mongolian beef and almond chicken , but they have plenty of other great dishes . they have a great lunch menu and very generous portions . come hungry . their dinners are served family style . the restaurant is a little dark and could use some new , updated decor . be sure to check out the huge mural on the north wall .
great authentic french crepes in phoenix . chicken florentine was delicious . the new dulce de leche crepe is a great addition . good service and friendly people .
everyone here is so professional and nice . great place to tan and i ll definitely be coming back . came in not knowing much other than sunlight tan skin . elizabeth was great , explained how everything worked , and made sure i got exactly what i was looking for . i d ask for her if i were you !
love the atmosphere , great service and surprisingly their steaks and salmon are very tasty for a healthy lifestyle restaurant . i highly recommend to anyone who has never been , and try out their grilled avacado , absolutely delicious . 
amazing . love the decoration the atmosphere . wonderful customer service . best pedicure ever and the colors are awesome .
i got sick . reaaaaalllllllyyyyy sick . perhaps it was due to poor decision making in terms of what to put on the hotdog fruit loops are perhaps too adventurous but regardless , i m not eating there again . the music is also eardrum splitting . not in a cool rock concert way but in an i want to rip my ears off my head to make that piercing screech stop right this second kind of way . not fun . no thank you .
great little museum . free but it s always nice to donate . people running the place were super nice . you ll see old bikes you haven t seen in forever and other novelty items throughout .
the atmosphere in here is cozy and inviting . i couldn t wait to have an alternative to starbucks for my morning coffee which was a great value . i had to go back for lunch and really enjoyed the coronation chicken sandwich . can t wait to try their salads and love that they plan to be open through late afternoon for those end of day pick me ups .
the building is nice , the staff are always very friendly but dr . kingsley and her nurse pam are amazing . they are always so nice and helpful and i never feel rushed or hurried to ask my questions . they can really put a momma s heart at ease , and i know my kids have a great team there to help them when needed . 
tried for the first time last night . our order consisted of: general tao szechuan beef singapore vermicelli fried wontons house special fried rice overall , good flavours , great portions and a very friendly staff . not the best i ve had , but certainly good . a welcome addition to the neighbourhood , which sorely lacks any kind of formidable chinese food .
let me first say , restaurant was not busy as it should ve been because the food was absolutely delicious . the owner who is very cordial and polite came out and personally introduced him self . my wife and i had the calamari which was tender and crispy . i started off with the red beet salad which was just absolutely spot on and i finished with the scallops which were done perfectly . i totally recommend this place for the food service and atmosphere .
premier hookah lounge . friendly staff . best shisha in pittsburgh . nawa will see to your every need .
man , it makes me sad to see negative reviews for this place . i ve been here a bunch and it s always been great . good pizza , a nice little drink menu , good customer service , cute little ambiance . not bad for a small local business . i ll continue to support angelina s !
awesome food . great beer and whiskey selection . good service . what more could you want . 
my family went for breakfast on sunday . our server was felicia , she was nice and courteous . i was very disappointed with my breakfast though . when i ask for over medium eggs i expect not to get running almost gross looking eggs with very running whites . 
love this diner . have had breakfast and lunch with no complaints . i hope to try some of their sweet treats on display one day .
amazing quality and low prices . the food is off the chain as are the arnold palmers . service is also top notch !
the absolute best place to go to if you are looking for any gear and or certifications . joe and owa staff really care about you and are willing to work with you to fit your schedule and until you are completely comfortable . also , all of the staff is extremely knowledgable and have tons of experience so you always feel safe in the water . i can t wait to continue working with owa in the future !
got the chirashidon and it was delicious fresh fish and great value . highly recommend !
the food taste like mexico . favorites are the chili relleno plate and the shrimp plate.
they get and extra star because we were starving , and there were plenty of tables . the food is standard dinner fare . we all had breakfast , which was good . the service was not great . it may have just been our waitress , but she was in no rush to help us at all .
really great pizza . the sauce and crust is simply delicious . it gets a bit chaotic when busy but worth the wait . nothing fancy just great folks and pizza !
this place rules . food and service are fantastic . for those pressed in time . good sushi takes time , it is worth every second . come check eli . he really cares about your experience .
in my opinion , this is the best jamba juice location in phoenix . it doesn t look like much , as it s tucked inside a strip mall , but you will not disappointed . workers are always friendly and smoothies are always top notch . i think this is partly because this is the model or training facility for other jamba juices in the area . go here !
every good and authentic indian food . + you can bring your own wine so it s fantastic . but don t be too picky about the service it s bring your own wine plus open by yourself your wine  ) .
the falafel here is incredible . service is good , prices are reasonable . put this on your list if you like greek , and you won t be disappointed . be prepared for a lunch rush !
this place is great . the white hot ( veal pork )  dog is amazing . the shakes are amazing and their hula ghost burger blew my mind . made with a ghost chili sauce with bacon , grilled onion and pineapple makes for a burger that s out of this world !
this is a typical cara restaurant . miniscule portions , inflated price , no staff , and all around bad experience . if you are hungry , do not go here .
susan is amazing , she did mine and my eye brows perfect and prices are great . i definitely recommend this place .
reasonable prices , competent staff , great veterinarian . our dog was in good hands with dr . beaumont and we were satisfied with our experience . would return again.
i just call after closing time . my mom is a older lady . needed her toes clips desperately . no problem they said . they told me to her over . now that s true customer service.
yummy cupcakes pixy cakes is an avondale institution at this point . nice staff coupled with moist cupcakes and fun flavors . also am a fan of their frosting not overly sweet and they don t put so much on that it drowns out the flavor of the cake portion . tip: get a couple pixy cakes and walk over to jt boba house just a few steps away for some teas . pair them right and you have a super combo of sweetness .
great selection of hot and iced drinks , better than big chain selections at a comparable price . service is always friendly . comfy , clean seating area is a big plus .
came for a brunch seminar was given free bread as a starter and it was cold had to ask for straws for my water ordered cobb salad dressing on the side and ordered the pot roast drinks straight lemonade coffee.
the weekend brunch is wonderful . so many small plates to choose from . be sure to try the green chili corn tamales and chicken and waffles . the unlimited mimosas come in several different fresh squeezed juice options try them all . service was excellent !
we decided to give thai princess a try after having walked past it so many times before . we went during one of the busy tiff nights but we were able to get seated right away ( thankfully , we were pretty hungry )  . i ordered the green curry with chicken with a side of white rice their curries do not come with rice so you will have to order that separately . the curry was decent but a little on the watery side . there are definitely better options in the area if you re craving green curry and willing to wait longer for a table ( pai , khao san road )  . my fiance got this fried rice dish with chicken that tasted good but we probably wouldn t come back just for it .
this salon has been recently sold to new owners . danny and his staff are gone . i guess that s why the website is gone . they will soon be moving into a soon to open location around the corner called diva nails ( next door to fry s )  . not the same high quality experience with new owners skimping on quality , product and service . hope the new diva tries harder in their new location .
terrible quality food , even for popeye s . i ordered the shrimp special , supposed to be hush puppy batter . the shrimp we re tiny and tasted exactly like the regular breading they put on everything else they fry . the ladies that work the counter appear miserable , and are unfriendly . ask for extra sauce at your peril , they will charge you extra . at any rate , i will never eat here again.
love this place . the atmosphere is amazing . the bartender is super attentive . the tacos were amazing . the prices are decent for them too . the best one was the braised beef with the hard shell , so juicy . only thing is that it s very crowded and when you eat you can accidently elbow the person beside you or vice versa .
the teacher s are great . they work hard at making parent s and the children feel comfortable . i like the decorative classrooms and cool crafts the kids do along with the great teaching !
minced pork on rice is my fave . food is served hot and fresh , pretty average amount of food for the price . place is not busy during dinner time on weekdays . as expected , more rice than meat for what you pay .
the chicken pho was amazing . loved the broth and good portions . a pho place in this area was much needed !
great provolone and mozz cheese blend with the crusty burnt edges from a well oiled pan . this is the pizza i grew up eatng and making at the local pizza place . recommended for a try .
have ordered several custom made cakes and cupcake cakes for special events and birthdays . amazing . great job , professional , friendly staff , fresh , never disappointed . would highly recommend to anyone .
i am very sadden by the closing of this bar restaurant . on most weekends when i wake up , i would ponder what choices i have when it can to eating breakfast . this place was so wonderful it gave you the feeling you were going to your mom s home for some good comfort food . it will be very hard to find a replacement !
horrible selection . there was nothing in this buffet i wanted to eat accept the dessert . which is what i ended up having . not worth your money . go to the paradise buffet at the fremont hotel on fremont street , they have more choices and international food and deserts .
i had the chicken quesadillas here last week and they were awesome . chris was our waiter and he did a great job . five stars all the way . : ) .
good breakfast joint . lots of options for decent price , along with pet friendly patio seating .
this place is so cute and i love the entire idea of it . they have a variety of things on their menu and all the workers are extremely nice . it s a wonderful place for anime fans because they play a lot of anime openings here . literally love this place !
this place has the cutest atmosphere ( definitely pinterest worthy and yummy drinks . the best cookie hands down is the peanut butter one with chocolate frosting .
usually order breakfast about once a week . very friendly employees and good food . wife loves the breakfast croissant sandwich and i usually order the big island scramble . suggest ordering the english muffin over the toast .
friendly services , fun drinks , good vibe , beautiful decor . your friendly neighborhood bar . i would recommend to anyone .
this place was much better than expected and a good dinner place . the lamb and chives dumplings had a strong chive taste and quite impressive . i could eat those all day . the stir fry lamb with cumin and onions was good but too oily . the tomato and egg noodles were amazing they used the right kind of noodles so that each strand of noodle held the sauce well . the service was efficient and i will definitely be back . p . s . one interesting item listed under the desserts was fries with oatmeal . if anyone has tried this item please do share !
i love this place . they are a friendly family owned business . their donuts are great too . i like to go there and get a toasted bagel with cream cheese , but i ve also had their donuts they re awesome.
love this shop . everyone is super friendly . brian savage is amazing . he knew right away what i was envisioning and drew up the perfect tattoo . i have been looking for an artist for a long time now and am so happy i found brian . i can t wait to get started on my next piece .
horrible experience . would not go back . the only good part was the massage chair when you get a pedicure .
family owned , quick , honest , and they care . best thing about them , they don t try to sell you services or products you don t need . great service i will be back .
my experience at mor furniture was great . muhammed was fantastic and really gave a great deal .
this was our first dining experience in downtown phoenix , and what an awesome meal . small , quaint space , with very friendly and attentive staff . even the owner walks around and makes you feel welcome . a great variety of rolls , apps and more . best sushi in phoenix . we ll be back for sure !
enjoyed a healthy and delicious lunch from a very diverse menue . delightful attention and atmosphere . highly recommend the alternative experience . i ll definitely return .
stopped in for a quick breakfast bite . enjoyed the bialy egg sandwiches and bagels . yum . the service was great too . emily was our server and did a great job even though she is brand new .
love love love nohea nails . everything is non toxic , organic , and fresh . they play hawaiian tropical music the whole time and it is just pure bliss . my sister and i got gel mani pedis together and just sat there relaxed drinking yummy cucumber water the whole time . i would definitely recommend coming in because they are amazing and so friendly !
terrible service . all of them are like robots reading from a piece of paper . not helpful at all . better service at mcdonalds.
this is my favorite pizza place . no matter what day of the week it is i can t help but to drop in to order a pizza for lunch and one to go . everything always tastes great and the manager brandon is awesome . i would def recommend trying it out .
we are never disappointed when we are here . the staff is exceptional and andrew always makes sure our dinner is perfect before leaving the table . love this restaurant . 
i love kneaders because their employees are so polite . this location was no exception . we got a smoothie and a croissant sandwich and both were delicious . we love morning sunshine and strawberry tsunami smoothies . the best part is they are really thick . i ve always loved their french toast but pretty much everything i ve tried has been great .
professional , honest , clean . ronald and martin were honest and fair in that the parts to fix our washer are pricier than a new one . we felt they valued our needs and budget . and did i mention how very friendly they were . we will absolutely call them again !
every single time i come here , there is always a staff member that asks if i need assistance . i work right down the street for a restaurant and they have just what we need when we can t go to our regular supplier . its so convenient . now its not sams club or costco nor is it trying to be but it does the trick.
this place is awesome . i finally decided to try this place for dinner and i was super impressed . all the food ordered was amazing the mussels are a must have . the sauce they re bathed in was good enough to eat with a spoon . absolutely incredible . the wine selection was great , and surprisingly , so was the beer . my boyfriend was very pleased !
i love jamba juice the smoothies anyway . it s too bad that the last couple of times i ve walked into a jamba juice ( this one or the one in scottsdale )  the combined smell of fruit , cleaning products and dirty mops really turned me off . i seriously love jamba juice but i m not excited to visit one anytime soon since i had the same experience two separate instances in two separate locations . :( .
legit taco time . this place does super great tacos . i would say it s the best tacos joint on the east side . it can get pretty packed at peak hours but that s a good thing !
best breakfast i have had since i moved to chandler . love the morning monte . wish they picked up the phone .
always take my vehicles in to mitch , great , honest customer service . never tries to oversell you anything . highly recommend them !
had a sunday dinner here and i love olive ivy every single time i go . our waitress , tess , was very nice and attentive . i love the hummus . its a little on the spicy side and oh so delicious . th patio is perfection , so check this place out . the ambiance is amazing and perfect for a date too . happy dinning.
excellent service , a little pricey but what isn t at vegas now a days , food was just perfect , lamb was tender , octopus fantastic . their hummus and flatbread amazing . definitely we will be coming back.
first time and was impressed . food was good and the atmosphere is great . our food took awhile because they kept entitling the wrong pager number . the owner came to our table to personally apologize and brought use dessert . i will definitely return .
great breakfast friendly staff reasonable prices what more could you want . the good egg is now part of the first watch which i frequent in florida , very pleased all around .
any of the pizzas are great . i love the bruschetta as an appetizer . my wife even thinks that the dough may be better than pizzeria bianco .
je ne sais pas pourquoi , mais j aime vraiment beaucoup cette place . je trouve que l interieure avec la fontaine est magnifique et j aime la facon dont les commerces sont situes . je n ai pas beaucoup de choses a dire sur cette edifice a part le fait qu il est beau haha mais bref , je pense que c est assez pour souligner ce petit coin cache de mtl : ) .
had to go . i drank tea : ) .
we eat here frequently and it s always good . the nightly specials are unique delicious and there is always a vegetarian special as well as several vegetarian entrees on the regular menu . and yes , plenty of meat for the carnivores also . don t forget cocktails sopapillas for dessert . great spot for a date or just a relaxing dinner with family .
i ve been coming here for years . phenomenal place . good bbq , good breakfast , good iced tea , cute shop , nice fish tank . it s a very unique place that is more upscale than a gas station car wash bbq shop might seem in the abstract . great for small parties or families . enjoyable atmosphere that provides things to look at while you wait for delicious food . disclaimer: i ve never used the car wash here .
sooooo amazing best burgers ever . i never thought eating vegitarian could be so great . i had their bff burger and wow my mind was blown . it actually inspired me .
great service and gorgeous arrangement . will use martin s again .
good food good service family korean fast food favorite . my daughter and my self usual is the jun special my son loves the spicy chicken and my wife gets the chop chae .
first time coming service was great , you get what youbpay for portions are pretty big so come with an empty stomach.
great service and awesome staff . dr chow is the man . found a good dentist after all these years . mahalo to all you !
grabbed a quick breakfast here and would definitely do so again . very quick , friendly service willing to put up with my miserable french . the atmosphere is bright and lively . i got the breakfast special hard boiled eggs , ham , and tomato on a croissant very good.
i am so in love with this place . i ve had about half of everything on the menu , and it is amazingly delicious . i can t rave about them enough . you must give them a try , and then you will find that you will agree .
this was the best brunch i may have ever had . each dish was sooo flavorful and intentional . my husband got the hash and eggs and i had the huevos rancheros , then we shared the sweet corn pancakes . the pancakes were out of this world with a homemade coconut cream on top . great service on top of that . their brunch is during the week as well .
ordered cheese dosas , mussel fry and a fish dosa . out of this world fresh flavors from kerala . i would definitely recommend this small homey restaurant . the chef introduced himself to all patrons and he happens to have years of experience with the taj hotel in mumbai , etc . now they are a start up so be prepared to wait . they need additional staff serving guests . but take out seemed to move smoothly .
nice , helpful staff but the furniture is a little too dated . think leather reclining couches . that said , i have some counter stools from this brand that i love and i don t think they re dated at all .
i just went to andrea today for the eye brightener and she did an amazing job . she tailored the service to my specific needs , and she s very personable and very nice . her shop is extremely clean and relaxing . i seriously felt like i was going to doze off while she was tweezing . my eyebrows have never looked so great and i will be returning .
it was good but could have been better . i really like the flavor combo of the burger but one of my biggest pet peeves is when the burger doesn t fit on the bun and you re left with all the other ingredients , that s this place . shoestring fries , lots of them . if you go during happy hour you get them for only a buck . if you have room left over go for a vanilla apple pie shake . with bourbon yes . 
the service was hands down the best ever we went there for my sisters birthday and they were just all amazing and funny and goes above and beyond for you . loved them thank you for making our night amazing.
i saw a food show telling that their ribs were to die for . i have gone twice since then and they are to die for , so so tender , they fall right off the bone.
i adore the gamjatang from this small momma papa place . it s small but personable and the food has never let me down . i ve had many items and not a single disappointment here . enjoy !
worst slowest service of my life , wasted an hour here . overpriced too . not gonna be coming back .
i came , i waited in line forever , and the food was blah . and expensive . nope .
great beer selection , and some of the best service i have had in a long time . we had the corned beef , and the fish and chips . both were fantastic , get the mushy peas as a side .
just had some pretty decent ground beef tacos here . they could definitely have been spicier but all the ingredients were really fresh and tasty . the guy behind the counter was friendly and the food came up quick .
this place is a gem . i m so glad we just happened upon it . the service was great , the food was delicious , and the prices were incredibly reasonable .
excellent and flavorful place for vegan and vegetarian options . a bit pricey , but i expect that aspect for vegan courses in charlotte . just don t ask for diet coke unless you want to see your waiter get a bit salty .  ) .
good diner food with options for all sorts of diets ( vegans to carnivore )  . not too pricey either !
first time i ve been there since they moved to their new location . now you have to walk all the way to the back of the store to pick up your order . the music is blaring so loud the staff say that they can t hear you . order ready on time . skimpy toppings , so salty it makes your mouth hurt .
curry was marginal at best and portion size for lunch was rather small . plus , when i made a request from the server after i got my lunch sized portion to upgrade to the dinner size , he just laughed and said he couldn t do that . told him i wouldn t be back in and he said , that s ok sir , have a good day .
for our first in out experience i suppose we were hoping for out of this world food but what we got was a pretty good burger ( with way too much onion , and we like onion )  , a really good shake , and crap fries all for a decent price . i don t know that we will ever go back but it was worth trying it once and defiantly worth the price for a night that we didn t want to spend strip prices on dinner . 
good place to go after a solid work out , tons of supplements to fulfill your needs and great service by their knowledgeable employees ( can t vouch for every single one , but the one i ve been dealing with most recently is great )  . i d much rather make my own at home , which is why i don t frequent juice smoothie bars often , but if i need to replenish fast then i ll just pop in and pick up a pure or decadent smoothie .
brunch with friends . amazing . the you buy we cook style restaurant has some of the best seafood . i had the fried tilapia and shrimp with coleslaw . seasoned to perfection . we even ordered pork skins . these were awesome best ever . the prices were reasonable . not a lot of seating it will be nice to eat outside in summer .
went on a sat nite due to a friends recommendation . atmosphere great food not so much . veal tasted stale steak caruso was very bland . endless table wine a plus.
been here several times when we visit madison . they just need to fine tune their service a bit . food excellent . ate at the bar a couple appetizers entrees and salad but had to wait and flag down the bartender for drinks . actually several others were sitting with empty glasses too . c mon pay attention and sell some drinks !
this is a local chain that serves up some really excellent middle eastern food . they don t serve my favorite , sleek , but they do have great soups , salads , wraps and desserts . the service is excellent and i always feel welcomed and comfortable here . there s lots of vegetarian options to choose from , for example , they have a vegetarian combo in the appetizer section that is amazing . i also love the smoothies , teas , and other drinks .
great coffee , good service . would recommend to come try it out . everyone was friendly , it was a very clean store and cool environment . was much better than starbucks ( no there were not any homeless people in the bathroom )  . ha . but that should wrap up this review , jon the worker was a key star to this review !
the smell gets you as soon as you step in the front door . the staff is very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu and explaining the options . brisket , collard greens , mac cheese were all fantastic . i m not a big bread fan , but the texas toast sandwich was a great option on this visit .
not super fancy but definetely charming . had a delicious brunch with great beer . service was great and very accomodating . : )  we re going back for sure !
fresh and delicious food the prickly pear lemonade is great and the server was prompt and courteous .
i absolutely love this salon . my mother introduced me a few months ago and i am so grateful . lauren is not only a wonderful stylist but a great person to boot . she now cuts and colors my hair , my mom s , my boyfriends and his mom s as well . we are all very different with varying needs and she flawlessly executes them every time . i feel like i have a hair ally with lauren .
un freaking real . so upset this place isn t closer to home . my fiance and i are into old bicycles and happened to stumble upon a flyer in our hotel lobby as we were passing through town . i had heard of it through ebay and didn t realize it was in pittsburgh . we stopped , were super excited it was free to walk through as we didn t know what to expect . we dropped some $ in the donation box . will definitely stop back in if we are ever out that way again !
again very pleased . service and food outstanding . had special appetizer of saganaki excellent . asked for extra crispy fries perfect . think server is owner . fantastic .
i travel all the way across town when i get a hankering for this high quality grub . i love their daily specials and all those old license plates on the walls are cool . i love the potato salad , and i usually dont like potato salad . crazy . 
i ve been using lesco optical for years . renae who works there is my go to optical specialist . there s not many places where you can have custom fitted lenses put in to your choice of glasses or sunglasses at an affordable price . they re definitely s personable business and try to make your look and eyecare needs your own . stop in and take a look you ll be back . make sure to to ask for renae . she s the best . 
ok pupusas y caldito . pero el platillo que segun es la especialidad . nos dejo muy insatisfechos . nunca se parecio a lo que an anuncian . la carne medio cruda . las porciones de arroz como mi para un nino . por favor sean consistentes con lo que publican .
the service was friendly , knowledgeable , and courteous . the portions were generous and delicious . 
i love this place . it has a great patio and a constant change in the menu with wine pairings that suit the meal perfectly . every time i go , i leave happy and recommend it to my friends .
it was my first time there . i ordered by phone on yelp on my way home from work as i pass it every day . i ve been trying different mediterranean restaurants to see which ones are ones i d like to go to and take others . zk is going to be one of my med restaurants i will be going to more regularly . you can t beat the price for the quality and quantity .
this cvs is a little small but every single person in the store is friendly and helpful . i love browsing the aisles while waiting for prescription refills and end up buying all kinds of beauty supplies i don t really need ( just ask my hubby how many lip glosses i have )  . the pharmacists know who i am and are never too busy to answer my stupid questions or call in expired refills for me . excellent place !
huge brunch buffet , my favorite on the strip . it has everything you could crave at any time of the day and the quality is really good .
